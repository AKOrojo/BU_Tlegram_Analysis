Message,17763,1639836943,2023-02-01T11:01:31+00:00,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"❗️Meta* removed Azov** from the list of dangerous individuals and organizations

Facebook* parent company Meta* has removed the Azov Regiment**, a controversial unit within the Ukrainian National Guard with alleged far-right political leanings, from its list of dangerous individuals and organizations. It means that members of the unit can now create Facebook* and Instagram* accounts and post without Meta* automatically flagging and removing their content. Additionally, unaffiliated users can praise the Azov** Regiment, provided they abide by the company’s Community Standards.

Ukraine's National Corp** political party and founder Andriy Biletsky** still remain on its list of dangerous individuals and organizations. “Hate speech, hate symbols, calls for violence and any other content which violates our Community Standards are still banned, and we will remove this content if we find it,” Meta* said.

Azov** is one of the most notorious nazi formations in Ukraine. Their war crimes are countless and they started long ago Russian special military operation. Ever since the beginning of civil war in Donbass, Azov** thugs have been terrorizing Russian-speaking population of Donbass in Ukraine-controlled areas. There are recorded testimonies of their fighters getting paid for “heads of separatists”, that is for any heads of civilians that they didn’t like. 

Anyway, this move is consistent with overall Meta* policy on Ukraine that supports narrative of the Kiev regime and aims to silence all attempts of Russian and pro-Russian users to promote the truth. Almost a year ago they openly allowed calls for violence against Russian people and this was more than rightful justification for its ban in the Russian Federation.

Will it make any difference? Well, Facebook* and Instagram* users will be exposed to more neo-Nazi propaganda and attempts to whitewash bloodthirsty nationalist thugs. Does Meta* know it? Yes, but they don’t care — any means are good in information war that they are waging. Of course, it’s very convenient to wage it in controlled information space. 

What will follow? We’ll see more of Ukrainian “armchair warriors” working day and night to spread fakes and keep fueling waning sympathies of Western public to Ukrainian myths. 

Of course, this lenient attitude applies only to Azov**. Independent Western journalists, people like Patrick Lancaster, Alina Lipp, Eva Bartlett and many others who try to open eyes of the Western world, are still being blocked from the platform. Naturally, all Russian media outlets are also banned. 

It’s just a pinnacle of Western freedom of speech. Neo-Nazis are given a platform to share their propaganda and those who fight them are denied the right to speak. Any normal person would shun such attitude but Meta* thinks otherwise. Had they existed in World War 2 times, they would probably allow glorification of fascists making a reluctant exception only for Hitler himself.

U.S. Congress has reviewed a draft law titled “Countering Malign Russian Activities Globally Act”. Upon reviewing it, U.S. legislators decided to direct the Secretary of State to develop and submit to Congress a strategy and implementation plan outlining United States efforts to counter the malign influence and activities of the Russian Federation and its proxies in Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, and other regions.

While such proceedings usually go below the radar of the general public, this one is quite important because it expands the previous act that covered only Africa and is actually returning the world to the Cold War era. 

▪️The term of “malign influence” includes such things as military aid, investments in strategic industries, getting mining concessions and even cooperation in ICT field. The draft law proposes secondary sanctions for governments and government officials in Africa, Latin America, the Middle East and other regions as appropriate, Russian government officials, and other individuals and entities that have facilitated payments and other prohibited activities that benefit United States-sanctioned individuals and entities tied to Russia. 

In simple words, it means that the United States is officially declaring Russia its “malign opponent” and is about to demand third world countries to choose between supporting Russia or facing U.S. sanctions. 

▪️This is unprecedented level of pressure even for Cold War times. Anyone dealing with Russia cannot avoid dealing with “sanctioned entities”, which include most top government officials. Technically this law would imply that the U.S. has the right to sanction people like Xi Jinping or Narendra Modi for dealing with Vladimir Putin as well as whole countries. This means that the law will have selective nature and will be used “on discretion” basis, which would open huge opportunities for corruption. 

▪️If enacted as is, this law can formalize destruction of US-based world order. Third world countries already don’t like continuous American attempts to impose their rules outside their jurisdiction and this may become the last straw. 

Open ignorance of the law by countries like China, India, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Turkey and other regional powers could give an example to the world and who knows, maybe even weaker states could dare challenge the former hegemon.

▪️By the way, the Congress has enacted one more resolution that requests U.S. President and directs the  Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State to transmit to the House of Representatives copies of all documents, communications and financial statements detailing purchases, recipients, and government expenditures that relate to congressionally appropriated funds directed to the nation of Ukraine—whether in regard to military, civilian, or financial aid—between January 20, 2021 and November 15, 2022. 

Surprise, surprise. It will be very interesting if this investigation won’t be formal but will be used as a tool to discredit Biden’s administration and make it a culprit. They definitely won’t find anything in Ukraine.

Message,16436,1639836943,2022-12-02T11:07:47+00:00,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"❗️France has announced that it is working on creation of an international tribunal “together with its European and Ukrainian partners”, continuing the idea that was proposed at the assembly of the European Council. This initiative serves two objectives. 

▶️ Firstly, this is yet another step of methodical process of framing and villainizing Russia and Russian people. It will use all fakes, unverified rumors and claims of Kiev regime as “factual evidence” and will likely blame Russia of all imaginable and unimaginable sins. Maybe they will even declare Russia innocent of some minor violations or debunk some fakes to gain credibility. 

This objective is important for European Council to keep brainwashing people of Europe and legitimize their own crimes against Russia (on that later). They need to explain Europeans that only Ukraine protects them from “Russian hordes” and they will create a vivid picture that will scare the hell out of common EU citizens making them happy to tolerate some “inconvenience” and forget economic crisis to fight the “universal evil”. 

▶️ The second objective is much more trivial. Europe still pretends to live by the rule of law and is still looking for pretext to confiscate frozen Russian assets stored in its jurisdiction. The process has already started with recent proposal of EU President von der Leyen to create “a structure to manage these funds and invest them”. 

❗️Starting from the beginning of the special operation, Western countries have blocked about $300 billion reserves of Russian Central Bank and about $20 billion in assets owned by private individuals. Freezing itself is a gross violation of all international laws and treaties and greatly undermined trust of the entire world in the collective West. However, confiscation would constitute even a greater transgression.

Therefore, Europe and the collective West needs some means to legitimize seizure or, plainly speaking, theft of Russian assets and the proposed “tribunal” is going to serve exactly that purpose. They will establish arbitrary assessment of damage and voila, Ukraine will get the money. 

But that’s just what Ukraine thinks. As we have numerously noted, European Union is undergoing deep economic crisis and there are strong signs of its coming deindustrialization with European companies moving production to China and even the United States. So, this money is more likely to cover a big hole in EU pockets that appeared due to “aid to Ukraine”, which of course was not “free”. Naturally, Zelensky and his team will get their cut to enjoy retirement in some sunny place 

All this is nice, but they forgot one thing — time for tribunals comes after victory. Russia does not acknowledge this tribunal, so instead of legitimizing EU actions it will delegitimize them and undermine global trust in the collective West even further. 

It’s a bit strange that this gesture came from France, which was one of the least Russophobe countries on the European continent and has its own opinion about Ukrainian conflict. President Macron reverberates the narrative of the collective West but he also has to listen to his people and it’s not an accident that many French companies are still operating in Russia.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2177.0,5.0,2022-12-02T11:09:04+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,2.0,254.0,MessageEntityBold,268.0,100.0,MessageEntityBold,440.0,18.0,MessageEntityUnderline,777.0,15.0,MessageEntityBold,861.0,17.0,MessageEntityBold,1002.0,15.0,MessageEntityBold,1058.0,16.0,MessageEntityBold,1124.0,144.0,MessageEntityBold,1363.0,51.0,MessageEntityBold,1510.0,13.0,MessageEntityBold,1566.0,12.0,MessageEntityBold,1768.0,70.0,MessageEntityBold,2610.0,259.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,473.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,473.0,,,,,MessageReplies,7.0,25478.0,False,[],,16515.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Message,15149,1639836943,2022-11-15T08:35:26+00:00,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"Recent terrorist attack on Istiklal street left 6 dead and 81 injured, several of which are in critical condition. President Erdogan called it a terrorist attack on the heart of Turkey. The suspect has already been detained and is allegedly a part of Kurdish terrorist group, some of the members of which are attempting to flee to Syria. 

➖The possible consequences of this act of terror are not clear yet. Looking at this, it is worth noting that Kurds are backed by the U.S. and the European Union and this attack will undoubtedly undermine Turkish relations with them and may even impact Turkish stance on NATO expansion and the Ukrainian conflict. 

➖As a condition for NATO membership approval, Turkey has demanded Finland and Sweden to extradite several dozens individuals that are, according to Turkey, related to Kurdish terrorist organizations or endorse those organizations. As of beginning of November, Finland and Sweden have not complied with these demands. 

➖So, if Kurdish involvement in the terrorist attack is confirmed, it is highly unlikely that Turkey will ever back down with this requirement and unless Scandinavian candidates change their position, NATO expansion will be out of question for a long period of time. Turkish society will simply not allow Erdogan any compromises on this matter.

☝️Moreover, Europe is not the main supporter of Kurdish independence movement. This “honor” goes to the United States of America, which actively supports Kurds in Syria. It is still unclear how will this tragic incident impact the relations between the U.S. and Turkey, Turkish position with regard to Ukrainian conflict and Turkish cooperation with Russia. 

Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said that Turkey rejects the condolences message from the US embassy following the deadly explosion in Istanbul

“We have received the message, but we will not accept and are rejecting condolences from the US embassy. We know who supports terrorism in north Syria, and we know the message they want to deliver to Türkiye through this bombing,” 


➖Soylu also blamed the United States, saying a condolence message from the White House was akin to “a killer being first to show up at a crime scene.”

☝️Unless some real explanations come from the U.S., it looks like this terrorist attack may have serious geopolitical consequences.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2481.0,4.0,2022-11-15T08:45:58+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityItalic,17.0,9.0,MessageEntityBold,26.0,45.0,MessageEntityItalic,1833.0,234.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,431.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,431.0,,,,,MessageReplies,7.0,25478.0,False,[],,15754.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Message,13394,1639836943,2022-10-26T15:05:10+00:00,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"❓Freeze and seize – new initiative of Ursula von der Leyen

➖This Tuesday President of the European Commission (EC), Ursula von der Leyen has publicly announced “Our goal is not just to freeze, but to seize the assets” with regard to funds belonging to Russian individuals including Russian Central Bank that are currently frozen in European jurisdiction. She stated that EU is setting up a work group to “establish of the legal framework” for confiscation of Russian assets. 

➖What does it mean? It means that we are entering a new era in EU history when Europe invents new laws and twists existing laws to justify what can be seen solely as theft. This initiative will create a dangerous precedent that will deal a tremendous blow to trust of any non-European investors in Europe could even raise concerns among common European people. 

➖If EU can make up laws to seize Russian money, what prevents it from making laws to seize money of some OPEC billionaires, Chinese investors and even European own banks on its own discretion? They surely think that this action is justified and they are probably really planning to use the money for the aid to Ukraine. However, an outsider can view it as arbitrary and biased decision way outside the jurisdiction of EU. 

➖If they can give Russian money to Ukraine, why can’t they give Saudi money to Yemen or Chinese money to Dalai Lama? Moreover, if they think that Orban is not democratic enough, what prevents them from giving Hungarian money to Poland, which is more “democratic”? 

➖Why is it happening now? First of all, it is about mirror measures that Russia can take in retaliations. By now most European companies have withdrawn from Russia, and left their assets under management of their local partners. This gives Russia little options to apply identical measures, especially because those companies that are still operating in Russia are in fact proving that they are truly impartial and won’t abandon Russia in hard time. This is worth a lot, so any actions against such companies would be unwise. This does not leave more opportunities for mirrored measures, but Russia is well known for its asymmetric responses so something will surely come when time is right. 

➖The second reason for this initiative is that Ukrainian president Zelensky keeps asking EU and everyone else for money. He needs money to pay soldiers, he needs money to run the country, he needs money to rebuild infrastructure, or he just needs money. It seems that the money that the West pours into Ukraine disappear within a blink of an eye, as Zelensky keeps asking for more, and more, and more. Sustaining a bankrupt country that tries to engage in military action against a superior opponent is a costly pleasure. 

➖The third reason for this initiative is directly related to the second one. It seems that EU is running out of spare money. It seems that at least some EU countries are not that eager to allocate a part of their budgets to keep Zelensky’s drowning ship afloat. Anti-Russian sanctions did cost EU dearly and continuous aid to Ukraine creates yet another burden. Considering the fact that it is highly likely that the U.S. will reduce its own volume of aid, EU will become the main Ukrainian sponsor. In light of energy crisis, unprecedented inflation and imminent economic recession they are naturally looking for extra sources of money. 

➖However, it is unlikely that this initiative will result in anything big except immediate termination of all remaining gas supplies from Russia. Russian assets will disappear in the black hole of Ukraine in a matter of short time and EU will face the same situation or even worse. One thing is for sure – winter is coming. So, no matter what will they seize, “freeze” will surely become their priority problem.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2225.0,5.0,2022-10-26T15:10:34+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,1.0,59.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,381.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,381.0,,,,,MessageReplies,11.0,25478.0,False,[],,14061.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

🔵 On 5-6 August the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) once again attacked ZNPP by shelling the critically important infrastructural objects of the plant as well as its satellite city Energodar. Twenty shells have been fired during the strikes

🔵 On 5 August, at 14:45, the Ukrainian shelling (three shells hit in the proximity of the training centre next to the territory of the open switchgear of the NPP) resulted in shutdown of the autotransformer and the high voltage line providing backup power to the Units №1 and №2 of ZNPP

🔵 On 5 August, at 16:45, the Ukrainian side committed an artillery shelling (four shells) of oil and fuel oil handling equipment and the site of hydrogen receivers. Damage of the pipeline caused jet fire that was localized due to timely and professional actions of ZNPP personnel and Russian military

🔵 On 6 August, at 19:42, the AFU units attacked ZNPP once again. Three artillery shells of 155 millimeters caliber (NATO standard) exploded next to the spent fuel storage and only 200 meters from the operating unit. One person was injured

🔵 On 7 August ZNPP was again shelled by the Ukrainian armed formations. The high-voltage power line “Kakhovskaya” was damaged. Equipment of an open switchgear (750 kW) was damaged as a result of a power surge. At Unit №4, that was operational at 10% capacity, the power supply of control and safety system went offline. This triggered the emergency protection of the Unit №4

🔵 The Ukrainian personnel of the plant has decided on cooldown of the Unit №4 of ZNPP, as well as downpower of the Units №5 and №6. Currently, the Units №5 and №6 are downpowered to 500 MW

🔵 On 11 August Ukrainian armed formations again tried to attack the ZNPP with missiles and UAVs. This attack was repulsed by the air defense forces

🔵 In addition to direct military threats to the security of ZNPP the Kiev regime is working on other scenarios to create intentional preconditions for a nuclear accident at ZNPP. Inter alia, Kiev is considering different options of cutting the plant off from the Ukrainian power grid and keeps increasing psychological pressure on ZNPP employees and their relatives (they regularly receive phone calls threatening them with criminal prosecutions and physical reprisals)

🔵 Attacks of the Kiev regime on ZNPP endanger the safety and security of Europe and the whole world. In case of an accident at this station the radiation contamination zone (more than 5300 square kilometers, length around 420 km) would cover the population of Kievskaya, Zaporozhskaya, Kharkovskaya, Poltavskaya, Khersonskaya, Odesskaya, Nikolaevskaya, Kirovogradskaya, Vinnitskaya oblasts, Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, border areas of Russia and Belarus, as well as Moldova, Bulgaria and Romania. The situation could get worse because of adverse weather conditions and spread of possible contamination zone to South-Ukrainian NPP and the nuclear fuel storage at Chernobyl NPP, as well as water arteries. The Black Sea and the Bosphorus Strait would become unsuitable for navigation for a long time. The shores of Abkhazia, Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania and Türkiye would be contaminated with high levels of radiation

❗️The UN, the IAEA, as well as all countries that have influence on the Kiev regime should do everything possible to ensure immediate cessation of Ukrainian attacks on ZNPP before they resulted in devastating consequences for the whole mankind",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,39916.0,260.0,,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,91.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,1308.0,,,,,,,,MessageReplies,0.0,25478.0,False,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1592391298.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Message,5117,1639836943,2022-08-03T13:00:00+00:00,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"Fake news:
Russia has not eliminated any American HIMARS in Ukraine, according to Reuters, quoting the Pentagon spokesman.

The fact:
The Pentagon provides no evidence for its claim, and Kiev and Washington keep confusing statements regarding the weapons being supplied to Ukraine. First, the Pentagon reports that it has no means to trace the fate of weapons being sent to Ukraine. And then a representative of the Chief Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine, Vadym Skibitsky, states in an interview with the Telegraph that strikes using US multiple-launch rocket systems (HIMARS) are carried out after consultation with American side, hence the US authorities are well aware of the location of the heavy weapons. Moreover, Western journalists even film the numerous news reports footage about HIMARS. It is therefore hard to believe another statement by the Pentagon, as it has compromised its credibility through repeated lies. 

Sixteen of the declared 20 HIMARS were delivered to Ukraine. Recently, the Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu reported that six launchers and over 200 HIMARS missiles had been destroyed.

Indirectly, the fact that the Ukrainian military has reduced the number of HIMARS is indicated by a reduction in the number of news reports on their use in shelling. While at the end of June they appeared on the agenda almost daily, now reports on their use are related only to strategically important targets - such as the strike on the detention facility in Yelenivka.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,2589.0,4.0,,,1.3276745489241844e+16,[],,MessageMediaPhoto,5.426903152768172e+18,5.386594785659256e+17,"[2, 97, 189, 237, 15, 0, 0, 19, 253, 99, 245, 147, 138, 33, 64, 228, 75, 242, 172, 101, 158, 107, 161, 121, 143, 135, 86, 189, 50]",2.0,False,[],,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,11.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,82.0,7.0,MessageEntityBold,124.0,10.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,302.0,7.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,506.0,6.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,778.0,4.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,1075.0,8.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,1349.0,8.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,589.0,,,,,,,,MessageReplies,0.0,25478.0,False,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1799870292.0,i,"[1, 39, 40, 216, 35, 158, 255, 0, 157, 33, 96, 27, 4, 211, 170, 54, 64, 204, 78, 72, 252, 40, 1, 119, 175, 169, 253, 105, 67, 41, 56, 4, 209, 229, 167, 247, 69, 40, 0, 112, 40, 1, 113, 69, 20, 80, 5, 121, 8, 102, 112, 15, 35, 131, 249, 86, 18, 171, 155, 161, 22, 230, 251, 216, 235, 87, 229, 159, 201, 213, 31, 39, 8, 216, 7, 242, 170, 237, 182, 45, 77, 216, 240, 7, 63, 152, 255, 0, 235, 211, 148, 109, 96, 76, 17, 55, 64, 51, 33, 207, 166, 106, 163, 151, 87, 35, 115, 113, 239, 86, 163, 155, 16, 183, 60, 47, 4, 154, 168, 193, 139, 150, 36, 126, 52, 158, 172, 171, 232, 110, 233, 179, 121, 176, 144, 79, 204, 184, 6, 138, 131, 69, 235, 55, 252, 7, 250, 209, 85, 53, 105, 16, 138, 250, 138, 147, 123, 33, 3, 211, 249, 10, 128, 130, 210, 2, 224, 146, 6, 15, 189, 20, 86, 147, 248, 16, 150, 224, 19, 158, 71, 203, 77, 117, 221, 33, 32, 124, 180, 81, 88, 20, 104, 232, 192, 143, 59, 62, 223, 214, 138, 40, 171, 150, 226, 71]",m,320.0,314.0,20235.0,x,592.0,580.0,"[4397, 10358, 16789, 24201, 39145]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After an investigation, it was established that there was no official arrest of Catherine. She was abducted with her husband by the special services of Ukraine and is now being held in one of the secret prisons. The only way to save the life of the girl and her husband is to bring this situation to the public plane, since such an action in any country in the world qualifies as kidnapping and illegal detention of people and is punishable.

The killers of journalists Buzina, Sheremet and many others executed by the Nazis even before Zelensky remained completely unpunished.
In addition, Volodymyr Struk (mayor of Kreminna in the Luhansk region, killed by unknown people when the city was under the control of Kyiv), Denis Kireev (Ukrainian negotiator with Russia, killed in Kyiv in early March), Yan Taksyur (pro-Russian activist detained by the SBU) have been killed in recent days ), Nestor Shufrich (People's Deputy of Ukraine from the Opposition Platform for Life, detained in Kyiv) and other individuals whose views contradicted the Kiev regime.

Not only famous people, but every ordinary person who is not satisfied with the regime in some way can easily be subjected to humiliation, torture, or simply disappear. Terrible threats come even for publications that are neutral but not beneficial to the authorities, for example, for peace talks, against the demolition of monuments, and so on.

These are the real ""exploits"" of Zelensky in the field of ensuring ""freedom of speech"". And the award given to him by Germany says a lot about freedom of speech not only in Ukraine. Whose grandson is Mr. Scholz?

America is no longer as tempting a place of residence for the world’s wealthy as it was before the Covid-19 pandemic, a newly released Wealth Report by London-based immigration consultancy Henley & Partners has found.

According to the report, inflows of high-net-worth individuals in the country dropped more than 80% last year compared with pre-pandemic levels. The figure fell to just 1,500 millionaires in 2022, from up to 10,800 between 2013 and 2019. The report states that “the country is losing its luster among migrating millionaires"" and ""the ‘American Dream’ is now on life-support.”

The report also noted that the countries where the newcomers originate have changed. While previously, most applicants for investment migration programs were from “developing nations who had weak passports, with limited visa-free access and low economic mobility,” most current newcomers are now from developed countries.

Message,103194,1731758208,,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"Individual income taxes is one thing let’s actually list what they did in Kansas shall we 
The Kansas tax plan collapsed the state’s three individual marginal income tax rates of 3.5, 6.25, and 6.45 percent down to two rates of 3.0 and 4.9 percent.6 In a similar fashion, the Trump-McConnell-Ryan tax plan would collapse the number of individual brackets from seven down to three, with rates of 12, 25, and 35 percent—with a possible fourth bracket between 35 and 39.6 percent.7 These changes both reduce the progressivity of the respective tax codes and give the biggest benefit to those with the highest income.
A key feature of the 2012 Kansas tax plan was its elimination of taxes on pass-through business income. Pass-throughs are businesses—such as sole proprietorships, S corporations, partnerships, and limited liability companies (LLCs)—that do not pay the corporate income tax. Their income is passed through to the owners and taxed at their individual tax rates. Together with the lower marginal tax rates also enacted in Kansas that year, this created a 4.6 percent difference between the tax treatment of business income, now taxed at a zero rate, and that of other individual income, taxed at a top rate of 4.9 percent. Recent analysis has shown that this differential overwhelmingly caused tax avoidance rather than economic growth, with many individuals recharacterizing their personal income as business income in order to take advantage of the zero tax rate rather than increasing real business activity.8 Kansas had estimated that about 200,000 pass-through businesses would use the pass-through tax break, but about 330,000 actually used it.9
The Kansas plan included selected tax cuts for low- and middle-income families, such as an increased standard deduction, that nevertheless were estimated to leave many of those families with tax increases.11 In a very similar manner, the Unified Framework would increase the standard deduction and possibly the child tax credit but would take away personal and dependent exemptions as well as other tax benefits, leaving many low- and middle-income families with a tax increase.12
After the Brownback tax cuts, instead of a booming economy, Kansas residents witnessed a sharp decline in state revenues, sluggish growth, and brutal cuts to government programs.18 Indeed, between 2013 and 2016, Kansas’ real gross domestic product only grew by 3.8 percent, while national GDP growth was nearly double that at 7 percent.19
Employment growth in Kansas has also lagged far behind the rest of the nation. Since the tax cuts took effect in 2013, total employment rose just 2.6 percent, compared with the 6.5 percent average increase experienced by the rest of the nation. And the story for private sector employment was similar, with Kansas’ 3.5 percent growth falling far behind the national growth rate of 7.6 percent.
In the following five years,” Dinah Sykes explained in a message to the U.S. Congress, “Kansas experienced nine rounds of budget cuts, stress on state agencies and the inability to effectively provide the core functions of government for our citizens.”21
As a result of the 2012 tax cuts, revenues plummeted and the state general fund debt load more than doubled from its 2010 level, leading both Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to downgrade the state’s credit rating twice.22 After several years of draining the state reserves of cash, diverting funds from roads, delaying payments from pension funds, and reducing spending on critical programs such as Medicaid, housing, public safety, and education, the state government still began 2017 with a $350 million deficit.23
Kansas citizens continue to pay the price. College tuition in the state has increased by 21 percent.24 In May of this year, block granting of funds to local school districts was struck down by the state supreme court, which ruled it inadequate and found one-quarter of the state’s students to be underserved in violation of the state’s constitution.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,2023-02-19T13:46:42+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,248.0,1.0,MessageEntityBold,477.0,1.0,MessageEntityBold,1522.0,1.0,MessageEntityBold,1661.0,2.0,MessageEntityBold,1868.0,2.0,MessageEntityBold,2141.0,2.0,MessageEntityBold,2322.0,2.0,MessageEntityBold,2480.0,2.0,MessageEntityBold,3129.0,2.0,MessageEntityBold,3377.0,2.0,MessageEntityBold,3672.0,2.0,MessageEntityBold,3775.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,True,,,,,,,,,,MessageReplyHeader,102402.0,,102222.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessagePeerReaction,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerUser,5204441531.0,ReactionEmoji,👍,,,,csv/original/Channel-ukrainewarchatroom_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fucker is a resident of the village of Glibivka, who during the capture of the Vyshgorod district supported the russian occupiers and offered them his help in the war against Ukraine.  He leaked to the aggressor the addresses of local residents who could be part of the resistance movement, including participants of the war on Donbas. Together with the occupiers, he broke into the homes of Ukrainian patriots and kidnapped them. After that, the victims were tortured and forcibly taken to the russian federation. During the one of such raid, the fucker committed physical violence and threatened the victim's wife with murder. 

Also, he looted the homes of citizens under the guise of ""facilitating"" the material and technical support of the occupation groups of the russian federation. In this way, he ""confiscated"" a minibus from a resident of the village.

According to the investigation, the traitor had ""preferences"" from the invaders in the form of free movement on the temporarily occupied territory of the region. At the same time, he even marked his own car with the insignia of the units of the russian occupiers.

After the liberation of Kyiv region, the traitor tried to hide in the territory of the region. However, SSU officers located him and detained him. During the search of his residence, the law enforcement officers found grocery sets made in the russian federation and cellphones with the contacts of russians.

So far, the investigators of the Security Service have informed the suspect of suspicion under part 2 of art. 111 (treason committed under martial law) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. The court chose the detainee as a preventive measure in the form of detention.
