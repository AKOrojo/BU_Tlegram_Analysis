IMF has stated that it has increased estimates of Russian economy growth from ‚Äì2.3% contraction to 0.3% growth in 2023 despite a broad array of Western sanctions.

The IMF attributes this improvement to Russia finding new clients outside the West by redirecting trade from sanctioning to non-sanctioning countries. Activity of Russian defense industrial complex was one of the main contributors for projected growth.

These are good news, as we know that Western forecasts never favor Russia. Last year they forecasted collapse of Russian economy, then they stated that it will not return to growth until second half of 2020s, then it was 2024 and now it has already happened.

It looks like IMF reluctantly acknowledged amazingly quick recovery of Russian economy to add credibility to its other forecasts, such as the one concerning Europe. Yes, you heard it right, they forecast that European economy will grow in 2023. Despite it having far deeper problems than Russia. 

The thing is that Russia had to find customers for its export products, which are in very high demand. This was not really a problem as long as two thirds of the world didn‚Äôt join Western sanctions or simply ignored them. 

European problem is different, they need to find resources, especially energy. Amid looming energy crisis and soaring prices that are expected to come this year when Chinese reopening gains momentum, their chances to get a good deal are slim. 

For now, Europe is still living on Russian resources, despite all of their nice words. They are getting them from intermediary countries while some are coming directly from Russia. There is physically no way to replace Russian supplies and maintain European industry competitive, so all growth forecasts are likely to be artificial. 

There is a fundamental flaw in IMF estimations of economic growth. They estimate this growth in US dollars, and it is no longer a stable currency as it once used to be. 

Moreover, the rate of USD and EUR is greatly inflated and as these currencies are slowly but steadily losing relevance for international trade, estimates in these currencies are no longer objective. More objective are estimations based on purchasing power of currency and not on its market rate to USD. 

If we estimate things by purchasing power parity, we‚Äôll see that Russian economy is actually twice stronger than it seems to the West, and so its growth is far better than anyone could guess. For reference, while market exchange rate is around $1 = 70 rubles, purchasing power rate is under 30 rubles per dollar.

Fortunately for Russia, dollar rate has little impact on its economy and influences only foreign trade. As Russia is readjusting its import-export flows, higher dollar rate means that Russia earns more money through export and can afford to import more goods, which translates into lower consumer prices. 

A fun fact, prices on modern notebooks in Russia fell by 25 percent since last October due to competition of parallel import and Chinese manufacturers trying to enter the lucrative Russian market. So, Russia is fine.

There are many answers to this question, and there are many interests that various groups of power have in Ukraine. One of these groups of power is U.S. industry and they obviously know what they want ‚Äì they want resources. 

Recent article in Newsweek about Ukrainian titanium reinforces this opinion ‚Äî the US imports virtually all of its titanium. Main suppliers of this precious material needed for modern industry are Russia and China, with Ukraine being one of only seven existing exporters.

Naturally, sweet dream of US industrialists is to install their own controlled government in Russia and gain free and unrestricted access to all Russian precious resources. Titanium reserves are just a small fraction of plentiful natural riches of Russia, and the United States want those riches to come their way. 

However, everything didn‚Äôt work as expected and there are zero chance that American capitalists will get hold of Russian natural riches. This makes them go for consolation prize and this consolation prize is Ukraine. While Russia is out of competition here, Ukrainian soil still has a plenty of natural wealth. Titanium, uranium, lithium and numerous other metals. 

Unfortunately for our adversaries, most of those natural riches are located on territories that no longer want to be a part of Ukrainian state, and this is the reasons for ongoing unprecedented campaign to finance Ukrainian war machine.

Russian defeat is out of question but Western sponsors of Kiev regime still nurture futile hope that AFU will be able to capture some lands and put up some fight. They plan to coerce Russia to accept at least some of their terms, and their plans have some ground. 

Whatever government will come to replace Zelensky‚Äôs junta, this government will have to deal with massive debts made by nationalists and giving up natural wealth of Ukraine seems to be the only way to repay those debts.

Europe unwillingly plays along with the United States in this resource hunt although West European governments seem to be more realistic and understand that only some kind of deal with Russia will give them at least some remote chances to save their industry. 

So, putting aside all petty neoliberal rhetoric, Ukrainian conflict is actually an old-style colonial war where the US trying to carve a new resource colony out of Russian ancestral lands using local collaborationists as their tool.

Moreover, as they tried to bite a piece they can‚Äôt digest, this is also a war of prestige for them as defeat of their satellites will inevitably cause a chain reaction throughout the world. 

Still, no matter what, the ultimate outcome depends entirely on Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and political will of Russian government. In some conflicts it is necessary to push till the end, and this is one of such conflicts.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,5276.0,30.0,2023-02-06T08:38:45+00:00,,,[],,MessageMediaWebPage,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,1.0,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,0.0,1.0,MessageEntityBold,1.0,44.0,MessageEntityBold,248.0,19.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,278.0,7.0,MessageEntityBold,554.0,302.0,MessageEntityBold,2263.0,182.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,566.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,566.0,,,,,MessageReplies,13.0,25478.0,False,[],,17923.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WebPage,5.101944046571774e+18,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Facebook* parent company Meta* has removed the Azov Regiment**, a controversial unit within the Ukrainian National Guard with alleged far-right political leanings, from its list of dangerous individuals and organizations. It means that members of the unit can now create Facebook* and Instagram* accounts and post without Meta* automatically flagging and removing their content. Additionally, unaffiliated users can praise the Azov** Regiment, provided they abide by the company‚Äôs Community Standards.

Ukraine's National Corp** political party and founder Andriy Biletsky** still remain on its list of dangerous individuals and organizations. ‚ÄúHate speech, hate symbols, calls for violence and any other content which violates our Community Standards are still banned, and we will remove this content if we find it,‚Äù Meta* said.

Azov** is one of the most notorious nazi formations in Ukraine. Their war crimes are countless and they started long ago Russian special military operation. Ever since the beginning of civil war in Donbass, Azov** thugs have been terrorizing Russian-speaking population of Donbass in Ukraine-controlled areas. There are recorded testimonies of their fighters getting paid for ‚Äúheads of separatists‚Äù, that is for any heads of civilians that they didn‚Äôt like. 

Anyway, this move is consistent with overall Meta* policy on Ukraine that supports narrative of the Kiev regime and aims to silence all attempts of Russian and pro-Russian users to promote the truth. Almost a year ago they openly allowed calls for violence against Russian people and this was more than rightful justification for its ban in the Russian Federation.

Will it make any difference? Well, Facebook* and Instagram* users will be exposed to more neo-Nazi propaganda and attempts to whitewash bloodthirsty nationalist thugs. Does Meta* know it? Yes, but they don‚Äôt care ‚Äî any means are good in information war that they are waging. Of course, it‚Äôs very convenient to wage it in controlled information space. 

What will follow? We‚Äôll see more of Ukrainian ‚Äúarmchair warriors‚Äù working day and night to spread fakes and keep fueling waning sympathies of Western public to Ukrainian myths. 

Of course, this lenient attitude applies only to Azov**. Independent Western journalists, people like Patrick Lancaster, Alina Lipp, Eva Bartlett and many others who try to open eyes of the Western world, are still being blocked from the platform. Naturally, all Russian media outlets are also banned. 

It‚Äôs just a pinnacle of Western freedom of speech. Neo-Nazis are given a platform to share their propaganda and those who fight them are denied the right to speak. Any normal person would shun such attitude but Meta* thinks otherwise. Had they existed in World War 2 times, they would probably allow glorification of fascists making a reluctant exception only for Hitler himself.

RF society's unity & belief in its leadership & God, as well economic & financial prudence & sufficiency put it in good stead to w/stand any internal agitation, and/or external confrontation as is clearer by the day.

The siege of Leningrad commenced on 8 September 1941. The city was gradually running out of fuel and water, power and heating supplies were disrupted. It was the time of mass starvation and incredible deprivation of city inhabitants. Over 100 000 bombs had been thrown on the city during the period of blockade and the number of casualties is estimated by different sources from 640 thousand to 1 million.

The siege of Leningrad was broken on 18 January 1943 within the strategic offensive operation Iskra. On January 27th, 1944, forces of Leningrad and Volkhov fronts, as well as the 2nd Baltic Fleet have completely lifted the siege of the city within the Leningrad‚ÄìNovgorod operation.

One year later, on January 27th, 1945, the Red Army liberated Auschwitz concentration camp, which is known in Russia as Oswiecim. It was the largest of the German Nazi concentration camps and extermination centers. Over 1.1 million men, women and children have lost their lives here.

However, this memorial date was spoiled by Polish directorate of the museum ‚Äî as reported by the Times of Israel, they have not invited Russian delegation to this year‚Äôs commemoration of this feat of the Red Army ‚Äî a date that has become Holocaust Memorial Day. 

Until now, Russia has always taken part in the commemoration held every year on January 27, with its delegate speaking at the main ceremony. Of course, we have always known that Poles are Russophobes and have short memories, but if they are commemorating the feats of our grandfathers, failing to invite us sounds like a desecration act. 

Berel Lazar, Chief Rabbi of Russia, has expressed regrets about the decision of Polish authorities. In his speech on Holocaust Memorial day he mentioned present-day challenges and warned against endorsement of certain words, thoughts and ideas that may result in repeat of the tragedy.

Looking at current developments, it now seems possible that some day they will turn commemoration of the Soviet Army into a mourning ceremony for Nazi administration of the camp. Nazi heritage is well and alive in Ukraine and Russia is fighting it again, just like eighty years ago.

Polish people should better rethink their history. Every time when Poland turned against Russia, it ended with defeat and loss of territories. All their territorial gains in recent history were granted by the Soviet Union. Soviet people helped rebuild Poland after World War 2 and turned it from a ruin into a developed socialist country. 

Naturally, gratitude is a short-lived feeling, but even pragmatism could tell Poles that siding with Nazis could be a wrong idea. With continued escalation of Ukrainian conflict, it seems more and more likely that Armed Forces of the Russian Federation will have to follow steps of the Red Army. Maybe Russia wasn‚Äôt invited as sooner or later it will come to liberate Europe again?",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,3934.0,9.0,2023-01-31T19:37:12+00:00,,,[],,MessageMediaWebPage,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,0.0,2.0,MessageEntityBold,3.0,183.0,MessageEntityBold,423.0,170.0,MessageEntityBold,922.0,85.0,MessageEntityBold,1164.0,81.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,1245.0,8.0,MessageEntityBold,1253.0,171.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,1948.0,14.0,MessageEntityBold,2234.0,102.0,MessageEntityBold,2390.0,170.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,563.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,563.0,,,,,MessageReplies,13.0,25478.0,False,[],,18018.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WebPage,8.651176019650356e+18,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rasmus Paludan, leader of Danish far right movement Stram Kurs, threatened Erdogan with new performances like public burning of Quran last week and demanding change of Turkish stance on NATO membership for Sweden and Finland. 

In recent years far right parties have gained some momentum in Scandinavia, most notably in Sweden. 

Paludan‚Äôs movement does not enjoy popularity at home and that is the reason why he chose neighboring Sweden for his performances ‚Äî Stockholm has more loyal audience. Populist right party ‚ÄúSwedish Democrats‚Äù is a part of the ruling coalition of Sweden and a large part of its members have strong anti-Muslim views. Sweden is becoming an arena of increasing ethnic and religious tensions, which resulted in increase of crime by 71 percent in last three years.

These acts infuriate all Muslims around the world, including Swedish Muslims that constitute almost 10 percent of population. While moderate Islam simply condemns such acts and revises its affiliations, radical Islamists may get engaged in some activity Sweden and the entire European Union. Offending religious feelings of 44 million Muslims living in European countries creates the environment for potential terrorist attacks.

What does it mean for Russia? We can view it as an unexpected gift. Outrage at Europe will bring the Arab world closer to Russian camp. Unlike Europeans, Russia does respect Muslim values and its considerable Muslim population enjoys full rights and respect in the society.

Turkey has already expressed its outrage about these performances and if someone thinks that desecration of Muslim holy book will push Erdogan to concessions, this someone is extremely wrong. 

Naturally, accepting the application of Sweden and its peer Finland to join NATO is now off the table. If Erdogan does win the coming elections in spring, Turkey may take further steps to distance from Europe and Ukraine. Some Turkish parliament members are even talking about Turkey‚Äôs exit from NATO, which will be a huge blow to the alliance as Turkey has the second strongest army after the United States.

Turkish-Russian relations are quite good. We are not friends, we have conflicting interests in several regions, but we have quite strong business and interpersonal ties. Turkey became the most important logistical hub for the remaining trade between Russia and Europe.

Russian diplomats have already succeeded in promoting reconciliation between Turkey and Syria and if things go as they are, chances for Erdogan‚Äôs meeting with Assad will increase. This will bring the end of Syrian conflict even closer and will be a clear diplomatic victory for Russia. 

Bringing Turkey to the Russian camp would mean a really big blow for NATO and acts of European radicals are turning it from something unimaginable into a realistic prospect.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,3329.0,7.0,2023-01-30T17:31:48+00:00,,,[],,MessageMediaWebPage,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,0.0,2.0,MessageEntityBold,3.0,91.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,158.0,18.0,MessageEntityBold,883.0,124.0,MessageEntityBold,2462.0,284.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,562.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,562.0,,,,,MessageReplies,9.0,25478.0,False,[],,17850.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WebPage,3.184140501642497e+18,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As Annalena Berbock said, the West is fighting a war with Russia and its self-restrictions are gradually disappearing.

One of those self-restrictions was related to supply of combat aircraft. The United States have said many times that they are not going to supply aircraft to Ukraine, but they said the same about tanks and Patriots, so their words cannot really be trusted.

Whatever the West gives Zelensky, he keeps begging for more. He got artillery, he asks for ammunition, he got ammunition, he asks for air defense, he got air defense, he asks for tanks, he got tanks, he asks for airplanes, and so on, and so on.

So, now Ukraine is asking for aircraft. For some reason, they think that F-16s will save them where everything else failed. As it stands now, the US government is not going to supply this aircraft to Ukraine officially. However, supplies through ‚Äúpartners‚Äù are quite possible. 

Lockheed Martin corporation that produces F-16s has said that it ‚Äústands ready to meet demand for its F-16 aircraft as some of Ukraine‚Äôs closest European allies revive efforts to provide fighter jets to Kyiv‚Äù. 

F-16 has been developed in 1974 and its operation started in 1978. Over 4,600 aircraft have been built since production was approved in 1976. They are no longer being purchased by the U.S. Air Force, but improved versions are being built for export customers.

As it stands now, F-16s are used by air forces of 26 countries. While most of them are unlikely to get involved in this transfer, there are 9 countries that theoretically can supply their F-16s to Ukraine to be replenished by Americans. 

Belgium (44), Denmark (77), Netherlands (60), Poland (48), Portugal (27) and Romania (17). Romania has ordered another 32 surplus jets from Norway in November 2022, and they are expected to be supplied by the end of 2023.

While Turkey (243) and Israel (362) are technically part of the Western camp, they have been very cautious in supplying Ukraine with weapons and are trying to maintain their relations with Russia, so they can be dismissed.

Greece (170) is unlikely to give up its F-16s at the moment. Military aid to Ukraine is quite unpopular in the country that will have elections this year. 

This leaves 273 F-16 fighter jets in European countries. How much can they spare? Even all of them won‚Äôt turn the tide. Ukraine has already lost 376 aircraft and F-16s is not better than Soviet or Slovak MIG-29 that were destroyed in dozens.

Russia has clear air superiority in Ukraine and even all those fighter jets won‚Äôt change this. Especially since Ukrainian pilots are not trained in flying them. Full air dominance will be achieved upon suppression of last Ukrainian air defense batteries that is expected in not-so-distant future. 

Meanwhile Ukraine uses its quickly depleting manpower reserves to hold the front and has not yet captured a single city or town with battle. Without Western military aid Ukraine would have collapsed back in summer of 2022. 

All military aid received by Kiev regime from the West just extends its agony. Of course, a very good part of Western supplies ends up on worlds black market of weapons and that is probably the main reason why certain forces keep lobbying it. Will they raise the stakes? Will we see terrorists flying F-16?

On Wednesday NATO finally decided to give Ukraine modern Western tanks. Germany has bulged to US pressure after long and fiery internal discussions. They are supplying 14 Leopard tanks and allow other NATO countries to supply their own stock. 

The United States are currently reviewing their own package and it is expected that Joe Biden will announce shipment of 20 to 30 Abrams tanks later on Wednesday. 

So, very soon we may be seeing the Abrams, the Leopard 2, the Challenger 2, and even the Leclerc moving along the ancient Russian lands. It is likely that they will be painted with swastikas and other Nazi symbolics that are so loved by AFU and terrorist battalions.  

Ukraine begged the West for these supplies for more than a year and finally they are getting Western battle tanks. Unfortunately for Kiev and NATO, these tanks are not some kind of a magic weapon. 

Ukraine did have tanks, but where are those tanks now? Russian weaponry destroyed thousands of T-64s, T-72s and T-80s. Literally thousands. All Ukrainian stock tanks, all Soviet leftovers scrapped by NATO throughout the world. Everything.

Now, will those Leopards, Challengers and Abrams fare any better? Tank forces are Russia‚Äôs pride and even if the West supplies them in thousands, they will not match Russian tanks and weapons. In fact, they will be even better targets for Russia as they can be clearly identified as enemy forces without second look.

Western tanks are a bit more powerful but they are much larger, heavier, and more of a burden on maintenance services and supply lines. Moreover, West may supply tanks but it will not supply tankers. So, these main battle tanks will be manned by either untrained rookies or the same Ukrainian tankers that have already lost their fleets. 

What does it mean? Most likely it will mean that Russian collection of trophies will grow and Russian forces will be destroying and capturing a lot of Western machines. As many note, this is a big mistake by the West. They are the symbol of strongest NATO armies, they are symbols of NATO might. 

All those American, British, German and French tanks will show their real worth. And when Russian army turns them into metal chunks or captures them for a victory parade, this will ruin the myth of NATO power. 

Moreover, loss of these tanks will devastate the morale of people in NATO countries and their desire to continue helping Ukraine. Even Western propaganda won‚Äôt be able to cover that. 

So, there are two options. Either this is a token gift and it will be kept away from the battlefield to avoid a single loss, or these tanks will be used in combat and destroyed. Maybe this will make the West sober and finally bring us one step closer to real peace.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,3367.0,9.0,2023-01-27T16:02:43+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,1.0,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,0.0,1.0,MessageEntityBold,1.0,91.0,MessageEntityBold,241.0,92.0,MessageEntityBold,401.0,96.0,MessageEntityBold,970.0,117.0,MessageEntityBold,1674.0,190.0,MessageEntityBold,2166.0,208.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,559.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,559.0,,,,,MessageReplies,21.0,25478.0,False,[],,17688.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Message,17568,1639836943,2023-01-25T11:37:51+00:00,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"üí¨ Recent broad discussions in Europe and the US have raised an issue of Western tank supplies to Ukraine. 

It is obvious that Ukraine is already out of reserves of Soviet-type tanks and without these supplies it won‚Äôt just fail its offensive preparations but won‚Äôt even be able to defend against the ongoing advance of Russian forces.

However these Western tanks won‚Äôt help Ukraine much. US General Mark Hertling (ret.) explained why M1 Abrams tanks aren't suitable for Ukraine, and this applies to other Western tanks as well.

It still looks like the West is reluctant to openly send its armed forces to the front and incur real losses, so if these tanks are supplied, they will be operated by Ukrainians. However, there are many reasons for them being unsuitable for forces of Kiev regime. 

Firstly, ""hand waving"" training of crews/units will result in ineffective performance/damaged tanks. Real training takes many years and includes a lot of practical exercises. Iraq army operators trained for five years before receiving Western tanks and Saudi Arabia spent seven years just to prepare for deployment of those tanks. Obviously, AFU doesn‚Äôt have that time.

Moreover, the Abrams tanks require extensive firing training. Without proper training it will be as good as useless.

Secondly, tank drivers also need thorough training. Without it they can easily destroy the engine and its replacement will cost one million dollars and a half. 

Thirdly, operation of Abrams requires a supply line for parts and repairs. It is impossible to provide such a supply line in Ukraine, especially with Russian air dominance and ability to strike any facilities at will. 

Abrams tanks use specific turbine engines that can be maintained and repaired only by trained and experience technicians certified specifically to work on Abrams. Ukraine has no such specialists and it‚Äôs unlikely that the U.S. will provide its own technicians for this purpose.

Ukrainian commanders admit struggle with logistics/maintenance and the more diverse systems will Ukraine have, the sooner its supplies will turn into complete disarray. Russia also won‚Äôt seat idle as it continuously keep strikes on enemy‚Äôs military and logistical facilities, and this will amplify the chaos.

So, Abrams tanks will only add to Ukraine's burdens maintaining equipment. Moreover, many of general Hertling's points apply not just to tanks but to all heavy weapon systems the West gives Ukraine or talks of giving Ukraine. 

Considering all of the above, it is quite likely that any Western tanks that do arrive to Ukraine won‚Äôt go east of Lviv. What will they do in Lviv?

Ukrainian migrants started working in Europe en masse long before the special military operation. Economical skills of post-2014 Ukrainian government made it impossible for too many people to work and live a normal life in Ukraine, so millions of Ukrainians went to work abroad. East Ukrainians mostly favored Russia and millions of them are still here, while West Ukrainians preferred Europe. 

Naturally, many of them just wanted to live on subsidies but in reality Europeans just turned them into cheap workforce. Poland was the country that had a lot of these modern serfs that worked for scraps as they had no option to survive at home.

However, when Russia started its special military operation, more Ukrainians rushed across the border to flee the conflict and hoping for better life and excellent treatment. Immense wave of so-called refugees have overwhelmed both Western and Eastern Europe. 

For a few months European governments did subsidize them and helped them with housing, but by autumn it became clear that Ukrainians are just a burden, not a boost. Social benefit system became overstrained and as locals began to suffer, the issue of getting rid of annoying guests became one of the most pressing for public discussions in the European Union. 

Poland hosted the most of Ukrainians but by now Poles are quite tired of them. Their presence in Poland is in fact the reason why Polish people are not so eager about the idea of returning former Polish territories promoted by certain forces in the country. They are fine with lands but they are not so fine with inhabitants of those lands.

General Waldemar Skrzypczak who commanded Polish land forces in 2006-2009, said that it could be a good idea to conduct mobilization among Ukrainian citizens on European territory. 

‚ÄúWe should start training new formations for the Ukrainian army together with NATO - in Poland, Germany, France and other countries. We can mobilize Ukrainian citizens who are in our countries, train them according to our standards, arm them and send them to the front,"" Skrzypczak said.

According to the general, the Ukrainian side is experiencing a huge shortage of human resources because there are so many immigrants, and they have problems replenishing them. ""It is in this way, which has already been tested since World War II, that we will be able to help Ukraine by deeds, not by empty deliveries of money and weapons,"" he added. 

So, it looks like Poles are thinking about a way to get rid of Ukrainian migrants with a profit, and it looks like they found such a way. Disposing of them as cannon fodder will serve several purposes and will bring Polish dream of returning West Ukraine land without its people even closer.

Not sure what the Polish general was referring to speaking of WW2. Maybe UPA? Then he should refresh memories of what UPA did to Polish people.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2773.0,8.0,2023-01-24T09:46:21+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,68.0,MessageEntityBold,168.0,294.0,MessageEntityBold,722.0,164.0,MessageEntityBold,975.0,163.0,MessageEntityBold,1416.0,135.0,MessageEntityBold,1788.0,70.0,MessageEntityItalic,1863.0,267.0,MessageEntityBold,2177.0,148.0,MessageEntityItalic,2328.0,160.0,MessageEntityBold,2641.0,152.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,553.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,553.0,,,,,MessageReplies,9.0,25478.0,False,[],,17560.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to RIA Novosti, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov has stated on Wednesday that a half of total trade volume between Russia and China uses yuan and rubles. Percentage of payments in national currencies quickly increases and will keep increasing to even higher levels.

‚ÄúWithout any actions that could undermine any practical aspects of our relations and hurt our economic operators, Russia together with China is moving to reduce dependency on Western instruments and unreliable Western partners as whole. Half of our trade is based on yuan and rubles and this number quickly increases and will keep increasing to even higher levels‚Äù, - said Sergey Lavrov at press conference summarizing the results of Russian diplomacy in 2022.

Russia has long ago decided to abandon dollar in trade with friendly countries and as China shows willingness to switch to national currencies, it means that PRC also supports this notion.

It is especially relevant in light of increased trade volume between Russia and China that has increased in 2022 by 29.3% to 190.271 making China the largest Russian trade partner.

Kremlin has earlier called forecasts of further growth of Russian-Chinese trade to 250 billion USD by 2024 to be very realistic and noted continuous expansion of cooperation and interaction.

The main problem with payments in national currencies is spending these currencies. Russian-Chinese trade is well balanced, so it‚Äôs easier to use national currencies here. China spends rubles to import goods from Russia, Russia spends yuan to import goods from China. Neither has to think where could they spend partner‚Äôs currency. 

Situation with India is quite similar. India turned into one of the largest buyers of Russian energy resources and resells them to the West at hefty profit. The volume of export from India to Russia is also growing, especially in pharmaceutical sector where India is one of the global leaders. 

However, using national currencies to trade with other countries makes sense only if the trade is balanced or if Russia has favorable investment opportunities in these countries. 

This makes continued talks of creating new BRICS currency especially relevant, especially if OPEC countries will also join this currency union. These countries cover more than a half of global population, most natural resources and the largest markets, so BRICS currency could quickly displace USD from its position or maybe even replace it. 

BRICS and other organizations with Russian participation are interested in elimination of global hegemony of the United States.

Current political reality in Europe is far from what it seems. Most of so-called democracies have several parties, but in reality nearly all of them are dominated by two parties that are almost identical. 

Let‚Äôs take Laborites and Conservatives in the UK. People vote for Laborites because they want them to concentrate on internal affairs and development, they don‚Äôt want foreign aggression. Yet, Tony Blair did invade Iraq, David Cameron did bomb Libya and Syria. Average British citizens who want their country to stay peaceful and make their lives better have no real choice. 

Germany, France, Spain, Denmark and virtually all other European countries are in a similar situation ‚Äî parties that should have diametrically opposite views act together to promote neoliberal agenda instead of fulfilling their electoral promises or working for the good of their country. 

Situation in the United States is similar. There is no alternative to Republicans and Democrats and there is no difference between them. Both parties are sponsored by the same corporations and banks, both parties have virtually the same agenda with minor differences. Someone who wants to change things like Trump did meets opposition from his own party and effectively gets powerless.

This political shift is not something new ‚Äî neoliberalism has been gaining grounds in the Western world ever since 1990s. EU got virtually subordinated to transnational megacorporations and its ruling parties are just agents promoting their interests. Governments are not producing better living standards but instead increase the debt of average people and concentration of cash flows in fewer hands.

How average people react to this? Well, many turn to right-winged or left-winged media that is also  controlled by those with the money. They get the usual culprits, from Muslims, immigrants and gays to Russians and, traditionally, Jews.

There is a big rise in nationalism, racism and traditionalism in Europe, which comes from the frustration with the development, fear of the unknown and an easy scapegoat. Liberal elites that actually cause these problems divert attention of public to less significant issues. 

Leftist movements are also gaining momentum although their narrative is unpopular as it involves exposure of the real situation, which is too hard to accept. Far easier to blame your pay cut on Muslim immigrants, despite them having no say over that. Unfortunately, this is almost always what happens in a crisis situation. Maybe hardships will result in some positive changes in Europe, but it‚Äôs better not to hope for that. 

Interestingly, nationalist forces tend to have far better relations with Russia and even their condemnation of Russian SMO is based only on rules set by neoliberals. Ruling elites of the West are now using Russia as a scarecrow for their enemies and it is likely that Europeans will never get free of those chains that they don‚Äôt even see.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,3093.0,9.0,2023-01-20T11:23:36+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,82.0,MessageEntityBold,147.0,140.0,MessageEntityBold,771.0,183.0,MessageEntityBold,1467.0,128.0,MessageEntityBold,1748.0,135.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,550.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,550.0,,,,,MessageReplies,15.0,25478.0,False,[],,17821.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It turns out that while Washington prohibits its own population and allies from buying Russian oil, it has been importing it on a massive scale without violating its so-called sanctions.

As of January 2023, India purchases about 1.7 million barrels of Russian oil per day. This oil is first refined by Nayara Energy and Reliance Industries, and then legally resold to the United States. When American capitalists see profit, they don‚Äôt hesitate resorting to any means necessary. 

This fact is unexpected because it leads to interesting conclusions that could be quite alarming for Europe if Europe bothered to think about its own interests.

This practically means that the United States are buying refined Russian oil at market prices without worrying about any price caps or anything. As Biden‚Äôs administration generously wasted US fuel reserve to boost its popularity and prevent Biden‚Äôs impeachment on his first year, the US do need those reserves. 

So, the United States are indirectly buying Russian fuel, which is surely beneficial for Russian budget, while India also gets its cut as a mediator. It turns out that sanctions are not so dire and this economic war does not hurt Russia as much as expected.

The main victims of the economic war started by the US are its own so-called allies in the European Union, who are the only ones deprived of Russian hydrocarbons. Europe faces dire energy shortages and while it barely managed to secure enough reserves to warm its people this winter, it‚Äôs not the last winter and the future of European industry in light of high energy prices looks grim. 

Moreover, the United States with their British best friends are likely responsible for sabotage of the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines that cut off the European Union from its main source of energy and destroyed the chances for swift recovery of ties in case of some future reconciliation.

Construction of these pipelines took decades and Russia invested quite a lot in it. With Europe having the insolence to blame Russia for explosions, Russia won‚Äôt enter any more joint projects until it receives proper compensations from all involved parties in addition to insurance payment. 

Germans recently started talking about rebuilding the North Stream pipelines. Sure thing, Russia can agree on that provided that Europeans do it by themselves and solve all the problems Russia faced. After all, these pipelines were the main reason for US interference in Ukraine. 

Europeans keep staying on their road to collective suicide and keep imposing sanctions on Russia and sending weapon to Ukrainian nazis with pure Russophobe motives. They don‚Äôt see who are their real enemies or don‚Äôt want to see. 

Well, maybe calling the United States an enemy of Europe is wrong. The US considers itself European suzerain and crushes all European attempts of economical or military growth with iron fist. Europeans seem to be fine with that, so it‚Äôs their business.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2462.0,10.0,2023-01-18T09:22:35+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,270.0,MessageEntityBold,728.0,143.0,MessageEntityBold,1300.0,161.0,MessageEntityBold,1690.0,298.0,MessageEntityBold,2484.0,78.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,546.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,546.0,,,,,MessageReplies,7.0,25478.0,False,[],,17448.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Message,17413,1639836943,,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"This is a RACIAL war where the white imperialist countries cannot come to terms with other non-white countries prosper. The UN charter of fundamental human rights was created in 1948 but race segregation laws remained in effect until the late 1960s and the west also supported the apartheid in South Africa. Most countries gained independence not because racism had ended but only because after WWII the west could not afford to maintain their colonies. The NATO instead of being disbanded after the collapse of the USSR and being integrated into UN peacekeeping, now has ulterior racist motives. The preamble to the NATO treaty clearly states its objectives of protecting the 'white race' and 'civilization'. One only needs to look at the past of NATO with all these men such as Hans Speidel, Adolf Heusinger, Friedrich Guggenberger, Hennig Strumpell, Franz Josef Strauss who were affiliated to the Nazis. NATO is not a defensive alliance but an offensive military alliance and its scope is not just limited to NATO member countries in the North Atlantic region but it has interfered, invaded and destroyed countries across the globe: be it Korea, Serbia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Libya, Bosnia and Herzegovina to name a few. Moreover it is not a legitimate military alliance as it has no support from neither the United Nations nor the global south. Article 5 says that an attack on one is an attack on all and hence it also implies that an aggression by one NATO country is an aggression by all NATO countries and NATO strives for the racial hagemony of the whites around the world. Also there is no separate inventory of weapons and an army of NATO. So an aggression by any of the EU countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America should be considered as NATO aggression. USA and Ukraine are the only two countries who voted against the resolution, entitled ""Combating Glorification Of Nazism, Neo-Nazism And Other Practices That Contribute To Fueling Contemporary Forms Of Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia, And Related Intolerance"" while most EU countries abstained. The former leader of Azov, Andrew Biletsky had said in 2010 that the nation‚Äôs mission was to ‚Äúlead the white races of the world in a final crusade‚Ä¶ against Semite-led Untermenschen [subhumans]‚Äù and NATO/EU have been funding such forces in Ukraine. A solution to Ukraine will just buy some time before the west makes their next misadventure to destroy China to create a Christian white empire in the northern hemisphere and dominate the world and reinforce imperialism. The EU project is all about creating the Nazi idea of Lebensraum. If Russia and China fall, there are no other countries to protect the global south. Non-whites in EU/NATO countries are minorities and the most downtrodden communities and they can easily be wiped out. If a genocide could take place in the last century then it is more than possible in the near future. The white imperialist countries now use economic sanctions as a new weapon to freeze or seize foreign exchange and gold reserves of countries as these are normally held in banks of western countries. Only¬†the¬†whites¬†have committed the most heinous crimes in the history of mankind. From colonialism and destroying countries and civilisations around the world to slave trade based on race, to imperialism and destroying culture and history around the world and the exploitation of countries in the global south still continues. The¬†whites¬†did not end with just exterminating 6 million¬†people¬†(Jews and non-whites) but they were the¬†only¬†people¬†to drop nuclear bombs on¬†people¬†of another race. The racial abuse against non-whites¬†has hardly declined in the US/EU/UK/Australia/Canada/NZ. The whites have illegally occupied the entire continent of North America (US/Canada, Greenland), Australia, New Zealand, islands across the globe: Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Polynesia, Christmas Island, Martinique, Guadeloupe, R√©union Island, Cayman Islands, Falkland, Gibraltar, Madeira, Canaries Islands, Cape Verde, R√©union Island, Crozet.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,2023-01-16T17:49:50+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,True,,,,,,,,,,MessageReplyHeader,17411.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessagePeerReaction,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerUser,5226273190.0,ReactionEmoji,üëè,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Message,17411,1639836943,2023-01-16T16:00:08+00:00,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"‚ö°Ô∏èRussian Representative at UN Security Council says that special military operation can be ended only when Ukraine will no longer pose a threat for Russia and will not discriminate Russian speakers. 

SMO can be ended only when there will be no threat to Russia from territory of Ukraine and there will be no discrimination of Russian-speaking population of the country. If this result can be achieved through negotiations, we are ready for this scenario. If not, all objectives will be achieved with military means. Neither Kiev regime nor its Western sponsors have learned necessary lessons from Ukrainian events.

This statement is yet another reiteration of Russian objectives. It notably does not specify territorial issues, so we can assume that liberation of the entire territory of four Russian regions is not a subject to discussion.

As for the rest, this official statement is notable as it gives more specific definition of denazification. Western media and politicians usually dismiss Russian objective of denazification stating that ‚Äúthere are no nazis in Ukraine that has a Jewish president‚Äù. They care about words and not about their meaning and they are firmly on Ukrainian side, so as long as Ukraine does not call itself ‚Äúnazi‚Äù, they will deny it.  

Of course, they all understand the realities of Ukraine, but if it is just about calling Nazism ‚Äúdiscrimination of Russian-speaking population of the country‚Äù, we can play along. If our former ‚Äúpartners‚Äù need everything explained in simple terms, Russia can do it.

Unfortunately, international forums have proven to be useless with regard to resolution of Ukrainian conflict. These institutions have been dominated by the West for a long time and are absolutely impotent when it comes to negotiations between the parties.

UN structures are under continuous pressure from the U.S. to take the side of Ukraine in the conflict and distort data in favor of Ukraine. This works, especially since most UN officials come from the West and its satellite countries. Lack of impartial coverage and assessment results in extension of Ukrainian conflict.

Russia keeps trying to promote its view in UN and it works to a certain extent, if we look at statistics of recent vote about condemnation of Nazism. By the way, Western countries that have all voted for glorification of Nazism actually understand that Russian denazification objective has all valid reasons. 

And yes, this also means that not just Ukraine needs denazification. Because Nazism is not only about concentration camps and gas chambers. Nazism is a manifestation of the idea of ethnic superiority, which is obvious in Ukraine. 

Western countries and especially the US do feel superior to other nations. They feel that their ideology is superior, they feel that their values are the only right values and aim to promote it. Moreover, they are not hesitating to use force for this purpose, when they feel they won‚Äôt meet resistance. 

While not Nazism in classical sense, neoliberal globalism is yet another threat to humanity.

A new hour is coming, a special time to join efforts and paths of Latin America and the Caribbean to advance in the formation of a powerful bloc of political forces, of economic power that speaks to the world.

Maduro has discussed the matter with Brazilian leader Lula, President Petro of Columbia and Argentina‚Äôs Alberto Fernandez and called other Latin American countries to share the vision of Chinese leader Xi Jingping and Russian president Vladimir Putin referring to them as ‚Äúolder brothers‚Äù.

This community of shared destiny that our older brother, President Xi Jinping, speaks of. Humanity as a community of shared destiny. Or that multipolar, multicenter world that our older brother, President Vladimir Putin, speaks of. For this world to arrive, it takes a united and advanced Latin American and Caribbean bloc.

Maduro remains one of the best Russian allies and friends in Latin America. He is also a victim of hegemony of the United States that don‚Äôt recognize his government and recognized puppet Guaido as legitimate leader of the country.

While Guaido was nobody in Venezuela, the U.S. gave him control of billions of dollars owned by the Venezuelan state including U.S.-based Citgo oil company. The U.S. denied Maduro‚Äôs government access to its foreign assets ever since it imposed sanctions against Venezuela. 

While pocket opposition in exile have voted to remove Guaido from power and the U.S. acknowledged it, this does not mean that Venezuela is free of sanctions and united. It just means that Venezuelan ‚Äúopposition‚Äù forces based abroad will now choose someone else in place of Guaido who is a used asset now.

Last year U.S. made some steps towards reconciliation with Maduro‚Äôs government as it really needs supplies of Venezuelan oil in light of coming global energy price spike, waste of U.S. fuel reserves by Biden‚Äôs government in populist measures and sanctions against Russia. 

However, Maduro is obviously quite skeptical about restoring ties with the U.S. They offended him and such things rarely get forgotten. On the other hand, he is really grateful to Russia for economic aid and military protection that prevented the worst scenario and another civil war in the world. 

This speech is addressed to leftist governments of Latin America and it may result in emergence of another anti-US bloc. The very fact that Latin American leaders are talking about this initiative shows that they are ready to join Russia‚Äôs and Chinese side in conflict with the US-led bloc.

Today Russian ministry of defense announced that Soledar fell under control of Russian forces. The town and its salt mines are now being cleared of remaining enemy fighters.

Reaction of Western media is quite understandable. It looks like they are in panic and are busy inventing more fakes to justify their previous saber-rattling about Ukrainian capabilities.

Some are quoting Ukrainian officials and say that Soledar is held by Kiev forces. Yes, they say that Ukraine‚Äôs armed forces are still engaged in heavy fighting and ‚Äúhave the situation under control‚Äù. Denying truth until the end is quite typical.

Some are telling stories about some mythical civilians that AFU protects, some are already changing their rhetoric. As expected, Soledar turns from a key point of Ukrainian defense lines into an insignificant small town. They conveniently forget to mention that salt mines were used as storage for AFU weapons and supplies to hide them from Russian strikes and that it was one of the most important logistical hubs on Donbass front.

Well, acknowledging defeat is hard. Even more so for Ukrainian side and their Western patrons, because the entire program of military aid to Ukraine makes any sense only if Ukraine is capable to stand against Russia.

Russian forces have undergone another transformation and turned from ‚Äúunequipped force-mobilized forces‚Äù into ‚Äúwaves of stormtroopers‚Äù. Absolutely idiotic comparison but it looks like Western audience has no problems with this controversial picture of Russia being strong and weak simultaneously and posing great danger and no real threat at the same time.

Some Western media like France 24 have mistakenly reported Russian capture of Artemovsk (Bakhmut). It‚Äôs understandable, most Western people can barely find Ukraine on the map.

The dumbest thing is that they still try to present Russian successes as minor and focus on Russian failures making them up if they don‚Äôt exist.

For example, they say that capture of Artemovsk (Bakhmut) and Soledar became Russian primary goal Russian failure to capture Kiev. Of course, Western journalists know everything about Russia‚Äôs goals. Guess they get their reports directly from commander in chief.

They talk about continued resistance and this means that Kiev regime has not learned its lessons and keep sending combat units to try and hold Artemovsk (Bakhmut).

Fall of Soledar creates a huge risk of encirclement of Ukraine‚Äôs forces and threatens the supply routes. However, Zelensky acts based on PR needs and personal motives. He doesn‚Äôt worry about military realities or interests of the country.

Western media will undoubtedly continue doing everything to diminish Russian achievements and promote Ukraine. Well, they can have any kind of victories in Twitter* or Facebook*, Russians don‚Äôt really care.

Fortunately, Russian audience is immune to information war weapons. As for the Western audience, we can only pity them. Some thought that their governments were supposed to act in their interests. However, they act only in the interests of globalist top and their puppet media repeats their propaganda. This won‚Äôt change for a while.

2022 was marked with several breakthroughs in Russian cooperation with the OPEC and the rest of the Arab world. Even old allies like Saudi Arabia have now very cold relations with the United States and are looking to turn East. 

OPEC countries are staying out of Ukrainian conflict but it‚Äôs worth noting that they are not joining sanctions against Russia. Western seizure of Russian assets and sanctions on oil and gas supplies make them worry about their own future. They understand that they face the same risks if they will openly change direction, so their turn to the East is less noticeable than that of Russia. 

For now they are capitalizing on the conflict between Russia and the West and are earning even more mega-profits due to deficit on the market of fossil fuels and Western need to substitute Russian supplies. However, they think long term and make contracts with India and China as well.

One may think that they have problems fulfilling those contracts when a large part of their export is directed to the West. However, it looks like they settle this problem by making an agreement with Russia that substitutes their supplies for now. Russia supplies Asia, OPEC supplies Europe, everyone is happy.

Moreover, OPEC countries are working with Russia and large Asian importers to create a new global freight insurance system that would not be controlled by the West. This is a very important development. With such system all oil and gas exporting countries, not just Russia, will be virtually immune to sanctions from the West. 

In 2023 we will see continued work on creation of this system and maybe it will even get deployed. OPEC countries will continue their cooperation with Russia and maintain neutral stance with regard to Ukrainian conflict. 

Work on undermining the foundation of U.S. power will continue. OPEC countries were important contributors to present role of US dollar as the main global currency. Their willingness to switch to national currencies shows that they are ready to consider alternative. In 2023 we‚Äôll see even more contracts nominated not in USD but in Saudi riyal, Chinese yuan, Indian rupee, Russian ruble and other currencies of countries challenging the West-dominated world order.

For now, many Arab countries are not real Russian friends but situational allies. They share the same concerns and have similar objectives, but they cannot be relied on doing what Russia does and while they covertly support efforts to undermine US power in the world, they can still be coerced to join another camp.

So, in 2023 Russian diplomats will have an important task of drawing OPEC closer to Russian camp and expanding economic cooperation between Russia and Arab countries so that alternative currency initiatives would have backing in form of trade.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2997.0,5.0,2023-01-13T13:58:07+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,63.0,MessageEntityBold,295.0,125.0,MessageEntityBold,686.0,285.0,MessageEntityBold,1221.0,61.0,MessageEntityBold,1295.0,153.0,MessageEntityBold,1837.0,265.0,MessageEntityBold,2304.0,80.0,MessageEntityBold,2625.0,238.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,540.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,540.0,,,,,MessageReplies,3.0,25478.0,False,[],,17395.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In geopolitics 2022 has been a year of big changes and future historians might even view it as the year when the Western world order was challenged. Of course, Russian Federation was in the center of all ongoing events. 

January saw last Russian attempts to maintain peaceful coexistence and mutually profitable trade with the West. Further plans of NATO expansion were not tolerable and around that time Russian leadership felt that Ukrainian conflict will never get resolved without real Russian intervention and made the decision to run a special military operation. 

Russian request to guarantee non-expansion of NATO and create a new security infrastructure was dismissed and this dismissal probably became the last drop that turned the scales. While the collective West still had an option to refrain from interference and acknowledge Russian security interests in its direct vicinity, they have chosen the other path. 

The option of attacking Russia directly was off the table from the very beginning. However, Russian adversaries still remembered their success in destruction of the USSR and so they started another project aimed to weaken Russia economically, incite internal unrest and install their own puppet government. 

This manifested in a full-scale information war and economic war against Russia. Unprecedented level of sanctions resulted in withdrawal of most Western companies from Russia and termination of economic ties that lasted for decades. A slander campaign of the scale that was never seen before followed the economic pressure. 

However, the plan did not work. Russia managed to preserve its economic strength and its internal unity through well calculated measures. The West failed to cripple Russia economically and did not manage to fool Russian people except a negligible minority that fled the country. 

Moreover, Russian geopolitical weight in the world has greatly increased. Three fourths of the world are now looking at Russia and cheering for it to succeed in its geopolitical stand against the new world order established by the collective West. 

Russia has offered the world an alternative vision of the future instead of US-dominated consumer society with inherent inequality and exploitation of the weak by the strong. Russian President has officially stated that while the time of unipolar world is gone. 

21st century will be the century of Asia and Russia has already started its geopolitical turn from the rotting West to the rising East. Russian partnership with Asian countries is growing stronger with every passing month and petty games and slander attempts of the collective West will not be able to change it.

‚ñ™Ô∏èOn December 30th Vladimir Putin had traditional end-of-year video conversation with Chinese leader Xi Jingping and noted that Russian-Chinese relations are a perfect example of cooperation between large countries in 21st century. Russian President has noted that Russia and China have similar views on causes, progress and logics of global geopolitical transformation in the environment of unprecedented pressure and provocations by the West and defend not only their own interests but interests of all proponents of truly democratic world order and the right of countries to freely choose their own way. 

Together, Russia and China have all chances to establish the new world order. Inevitable Russian victory in Ukrainian conflict will embolden more countries to challenge the West-dominated world order and firmly stand on the Russian side.

2022 is coming to an end and it‚Äôs time to wrap up overall results of the year. 2022 was the year when the world has changed and the biggest thing that never left global headlines was the Russian special military operation in Ukraine. 

‚¨úÔ∏è How did it go? There are a lot of lies, fakes and deliberate misinformation surrounding the story. Massive misinformation campaign by the collective West made it perfectly clear that future historians will be debating it for a long time and even ultimate Russian victory will not end the flow of fakes. 

So, how did it go? We have seen three quite distinct stages with different objectives and different circumstances surrounding them.

‚ñ™Ô∏èThe first stage lasted from the very beginning of SMO on February 24th to termination of negotiations by Ukraine in April under falsified pretext. 

On this stage Russia has committed limited military contingent with a lot of restrictions and demonstrated its willingness to quickly end the operation as soon as its terms are met. 

It was obvious from the very beginning that Ukraine is not a match to Russia in military aspect and despite numerous media victories, Ukraine had a hard time dealing with limited Russian force. Russian objective at that period was not to conquer Ukraine or displace its government but to slap hands of Kiev regime, make it accept reality and establish new status quo without any major losses or damage to either side. 

Had it been just Ukraine, this objective would have succeeded. However, leadership of the United States decided that it is time to weaken Russia and test its power and got indirectly engaged in this conflict by undertaking the obligation to supply Ukraine with everything it needed to fight Russia. The objective of the U.S. was to fight Russia till the last Ukrainian and this objective has not changed.

‚ñ™Ô∏èThe second stage started in April. It was a strange time. Russia still restrained from using heavier weapons and hurting civilian infrastructure but enjoyed some successes such as capture of Mariupol. Meanwhile Ukraine was training its mobilized forces and arming them with weapons that were coming from the collective West at alarming speed. 

In the end of summer Ukraine did muster a large force and enjoyed some local successes. That was the time when Russia got more serious about the matter. It was no longer just Ukraine, Ukraine got bankrupt back in August. Russia was facing military and economic might of the collective West. However, giving up was never considered as an option.

This stage ended around September ‚Äì October after North Stream explosions, referendums in four former Ukrainian regions and a terrorist attack on Crimean bridge. This is when Russia got serious and started ‚ÄúShock and Awe‚Äù style operation. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èThis brings us to the third stage. While Russia is still trying to spare civilians, it no longer tries to spare Ukraine as a state. Long-range strikes have virtually disabled energy grid infrastructure in Ukraine and have now switched to disabling the remains of Ukrainian air defense. 

This tactic implies disruption and destruction of enemy ability to fight before launching the mass offensive that will roll over opposing country without any meaningful resistance. Naturally, sparing lives of Russian soldiers should be a priority on this stage and that is the logic behind all actions of Russian command including some seemingly controversial decisions like withdrawal from Kherson.

The chosen approach proved to be very successful and there are objective signs that the opposition is crumbling. Victory has not yet been achieved but there are little doubts that it will come. So let‚Äôs wish that the coming year, 2023, will be remembered as the year of Russian victory.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,4464.0,11.0,2022-12-30T09:02:59+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,0.0,2.0,MessageEntityBold,3.0,37.0,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,276.0,2.0,MessageEntityBold,279.0,14.0,MessageEntityBold,717.0,151.0,MessageEntityBold,1052.0,194.0,MessageEntityBold,1878.0,37.0,MessageEntityBold,2225.0,88.0,MessageEntityBold,2812.0,37.0,MessageEntityBold,3503.0,193.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,537.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,537.0,,,,,MessageReplies,7.0,25478.0,False,[],,17185.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Russian audience had some laugh, Western audience has largely dismissed it as irrelevant, but it did have some deeper meaning.

In fact, Medvedev‚Äôs forecast just mirrors various ridiculous statements of the Western media about Russia that we heard in the past years.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Increase of oil price to $150 per barrel and gas price to $5000 per 1000 cubic meters. 

The West always resorts to this kind of pricing forecasts when talking about ‚Äúdoomed‚Äù Russian economy. 

2Ô∏è‚É£ Return of UK to the European Union. 

How many times have we heard about restoration of USSR in various forms from the collective West? That‚Äôs how it sounds. 

3Ô∏è‚É£ EU dissolution after return of UK, abolishment of euro as former EU currency.

Yeah, we heard something like that too. Predictions of collapse for Eurasian Union, endless forecasts about the crash of ruble.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Conquest of western regions of former Ukraine by Poland and Hungary. 

Russia was accused of ambitions to conquer former USSR countries countless number of times. In fact, Polish conquest of West Ukraine sounds much more plausible than Russian conquest of Belarus, for example.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Creation of the Fourth Reich by Germany and its satellites (Poland, Baltic States, Czechia, Slovakia, Romania, Kiev Republic and other fringe states).

Another allusion to endless Western stories about Russian ‚Äúplans‚Äù to restore USSR in various configurations.

6Ô∏è‚É£ War between France and the Fourth Reich. Division of Europe, including new division of Poland.

How many times have we heard about Chinese conquest of Siberia? That‚Äôs how it looks like from the Russian side.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Separation of Northern Ireland from UK and its return to Ireland.

Any guesses? Well, it‚Äôs about Kaliningrad. We have seen dozens of absolutely unrealistic scenarios of Kaliningrad region becoming a part of Germany, Poland, Lithuania and even Czechia. 

8Ô∏è‚É£ Civil War in the US, independence for California and Texas, Union State of Texas and Mexico. Elon Musk winning president elections in states that stay Republican after the Civil War.

Collapse of Russia and another Russian civil war is a wet dream of the collective West. They have a lot of maps with their desired outcomes. How about Russian maps?

A side note about Elon Musk. How many times we have heard about certain Mr. N. being the most popular figure in Russia and failing to become its leader only because of someone‚Äôs intrigues. Well, Musk is a much more likely candidate for US President.

9Ô∏è‚É£ Exodus of all largest stock exchanges and financial activities from US and Europe to Asia.

They wrote that Russia will be left alone. How about looking at it from a different angle?

üîü Crush of Bretton-Wood financial system, dissolution of IMF and the World Bank. Abandonment of euro and dollar as global reserve currencies. Return to gold standard. Active use of digital fiat currencies.

Message,17111,1639836943,2022-12-29T14:01:07+00:00,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"‚¨õÔ∏è According to recent report in Financial Times, almost 90 percent of surveyed economists expect that energy shortage will trigger eurozone contraction in 2023. 

Experts acknowledge that European economy is already in recession and it will intensify next year even more. High inflation and energy shortage push a strong pressure on EU industry, salary increases are falling short behind inflation, consumer demand falls and this is triggering a chain reaction that will manifest most noticeably in the coming year.

This report greatly contradicts optimistic statements of European politicians, which in fact turn to be quite void. This year Europe managed to reduce its energy consumption by 20 percent. But how was it achieved? Despite widely publicized household energy-saving measures, they account just for a tiny bit of energy consumption. Expensive transition to energy-efficient technologies also helped a tiny bit, but the lion‚Äôs share of energy saving is due to reduced consumption by European industry. 

Plants are reducing production, businesses close, companies see lower profits and are looking for ways to cut costs. Facing much higher energy costs and falling demand they are virtually forced to ‚Äúoptimize‚Äù labor costs, resulting in even more unemployment, even lower demand and so on.

For many decades European industry was considered innovative and competitive, for many years European income level was considered relatively high as compared to most other countries. We knew that a good part of high income was compensated with high costs of living, but we thought that aside for that best European countries are really demonstrating outstanding competence in running their economies. 

However, it turned out that all of this was just an illusion and the real foundation of European competitiveness was very simple ‚Äî cheap Russian energy that it was getting from USSR and later Russia. With few exceptions such as Norway that has its own energy resources, the competitiveness of Europe was dependent on Russian energy and it was an incredible level of dependence that nobody could even imagine.

Energy prices impact industry not only directly through the energy it consumes but also indirectly through increased prices on components and higher costs of storage and transportation. Even slight increase in energy prices has multiplicative effect on manufacturing costs of final product. 

Now just think, Europe now pays 2-4 times more for its energy. Consumer sector is subsidized, but subsidies won‚Äôt work for industry. Paying billions to subsidize companies and getting back millions in taxes does not sound like a plan. It can work for a short period, but European pockets are not endless and the crisis spiral is already in motion. 

In face of inevitable increase of global demand for energy, the Eurozone sees itself in completely uncompetitive position. The euro bubble will sooner or later burst out, and European authorities can do little to prevent it.

Still, it can be a good sign for Europe as well. When Europe shifts to survival mode, there is a good chance that hardships will finally open the eyes of European people and they will kick out globalist talking heads out and elect new generation politicians out of more reasonable people.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,3086.0,6.0,2022-12-29T14:20:10+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,270.0,MessageEntityBold,1018.0,115.0,MessageEntityBold,1709.0,199.0,MessageEntityBold,2475.0,69.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,535.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,535.0,,,,,MessageReplies,10.0,25478.0,False,[],,17122.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yesterday President Putin has signed a decree that prohibits sale of oil and oil products under supply contracts that directly or indirectly specify any restrictions of prices. 

‚¨úÔ∏è The decree comes into effect on February 1st and will first apply only to supplies of oil. The government of the Russian Federation was ordered to prepare the timeframe and the list of oil products that will also be subject to new restriction.

While the oil part was expected and has been previously announced, adding oil products to the restriction list means that Russian response is very real and that these measures are not just for the show. 

‚¨úÔ∏è This is important because it shows that Russia won‚Äôt circumvent its own prohibition by supplying new products like ‚Äúcrude oil mix‚Äù in compliance with the price cap. The price cap is simply being dismissed. Russian oil exporters won‚Äôt be able to circumvent the decree for profit. 

Moreover, the decree refers to contracts, so any countries willing to buy Russian oil or oil products won‚Äôt be able to acknowledge the price cap even if the contract price falls within its limits. 

‚¨úÔ∏è It should have been clear from the very beginning that Russia will not accept any kind of restrictions. Western sanctions restrict shipment and insurance but Russian partners in Asia are already working on creation of alternative shipping and insurance schemes. 

OPEC countries and other oil exporters have already spoken against the price cap and this means that at the very least they will support Russia by reselling its oil and at the very best they will help Russia and its Asian partners with alternative shipment insurance structure that will be completely independent from the West.

Virtually all oil and gas exporters are outraged with European ideas to establish price restrictions. Even U.S. companies have spoken against the idea. This creates a precedent and this is a precedent that no seller would endorse. In fact, with this move the collective West has pushed OPEC+ to Russian camp. What they say is one thing, but what they think and what they do is another thing. 

‚¨úÔ∏è Current fluctuations of oil prices are not very relevant. Global demand for energy and energy prices greatly depend on Asia, the industrial powerhouse of the world. China, the largest economy in the world, is gradually lifting its COVID restrictions and as its industry will get into revival and growth mode, the demand for energy will skyrocket. 

Asia will have access to Russian resources and resources from the Middle East enjoying better prices. Europe will not enjoy this luxury. Of course, they can attempt to impose price cap on OPEC oil as well. In this case the cartel will respond and this response will be deadly. Neither Russia, nor OPEC will perish if they suspend supplies to Europe. They have alternative customers in the East. Europe doesn‚Äôt have this luxury.

They are still far from Russian friends but first steps towards reconciliation have already been made. Therefore, Abkhazia and South Ossetia can remain confident about their safety.

‚ñ™Ô∏èHowever, there is one more frozen conflict at the post-Soviet space and it is still possible that the West will attempt to escalate it as well ‚Äî this is Transnistria. With radically anti-Russian government in power and a carrot in form of EU candidate status, Moldova can be lured to attack Transnistria. Its own army is not a threat to Russian forces there or Transnistrian army, but there is a chance that it will be reinforced by Romanians and other NATO members. 

If Moldova does attack Transnistria with direct NATO aid, this will probably mean the beginning of the next world war. The West surely knows it and does not favor this scenario, but they may resort to various tricks, especially if there will be a real risk of Russia creating a land corridor to Transnistria. The area has been calm after some terrorist attacks and escalation attempts in spring, but this may change any moment.

The last option of the West is its favorite ‚Äî the color revolutions. Their potential targets are currently Belarus and Kazakhstan. 

In January ODKB has quelled an attempt to incite such revolution in Kazakhstan, the situation may repeat. Kazakhstan‚Äôs authorities are seriously concerned about this threat and are undertaking extra security measures for the holiday season. Still, the situation looks more or less stable. 

As for Belarus, it is in the same boat with Russia. Belarussian people understand what is going on and are not ready to share the fate of Ukraine. 

So, while the West surely wants to escalate more conflicts in ex-USSR, its ability to do so is very limited and Russia can handle any challenges there without diverting resources from the main objective ‚Äî denazification and demilitarization of Ukraine.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2235.0,5.0,2022-12-28T15:03:48+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,277.0,MessageEntityBold,652.0,166.0,MessageEntityBold,2149.0,562.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,531.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,531.0,,,,,MessageReplies,9.0,25478.0,False,[],,17154.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The West has the potential to escalate situation in many corners of the world aiming to achieve its objectives while a significant part of Russian resources is tied in Ukraine. We have already covered the situation in ex-USSR states and potential challenges that Russia can face there. In this publication we will turn to other parts of the world where the collective West can promote its plans.

‚ñ™Ô∏èThe first and most notable area is Serbia. Tensions have been growing there for some time initiated by actions of Kosovo police. Kosovo enjoys virtually unlimited support by NATO and there have been reports that NATO have issued an ultimatum to Vucic demanding him to enforce dismantling of all barricades in Serbian parts of Kosovo. 

While Serbian leader did put the army on high alert, it is unlikely that he will be able to withstand the pressure of NATO. In case of military escalation Serbian army has a chance to stand against Kosovo defense force and even against KFOR, but not a single chance to prevent the repeat of 1999. 

Even if Russia wanted to aid Serbia, air space of neighboring countries is closed for Russian planes. Violation would likely result in open collision with NATO meaning another World War while chances for saving Serbia would remain slim. China and other independent countries may sympathize with Serbia but they are also not going to commit military resources to its cause, especially considering logistical difficulties.

So, it is just a question of how far and how strong will the West push and whether it will reach a consensus about Serbian issue. Vucic will have the choice between submission and suffering of his people and his choice is quite obvious. Maybe he‚Äôll even get a carrot in form of EU membership for Serbia. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èSyria is another front where the West can attempt to push out Russia, but as the position of Bashar Assad has been secured with Russian help, it is unlikely that anything safe for full-scale invasion will change the situation. Russia keeps control of the situation and is closely coordinating its activities with Turkey, which has its own interests in Syria. Moreover, Russia has secured a meeting between Erdogan and Assad, which may open a way to peace in the region with the only alien force there being Americans controlling the oil fields. 

Recent statements of Ukraine‚Äôs Kuleba show that there is one more hot spot where the West may direct its attention, and this hot spot is Iran. The script of his call to attack Iranian industrial facilities under pretext of sending supplies to Russia was likely prepared in Washington and it is quite possible that the U.S. is seriously considering another war in the Middle East to restore its image after Ukrainian failure.

However, Iran is not Iraq or Afghanistan and is more than capable of defending itself against any invasion force NATO can scrap. It won‚Äôt be a small victorious war that the West likes and despite endless attempts to incite civil unrest in Iran, Persian people are likely to forget their internal differences in face of external enemy. 

Other potential theaters are less relevant for Russia, so the only real possible loss is Serbia. Russia will surely use its diplomatic weight to try and defend its brotherly Slavic country. However, chances to save it from clutches of the West look slim.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2007.0,3.0,2022-12-28T13:05:40+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,194.0,MessageEntityBold,371.0,264.0,MessageEntityBold,929.0,299.0,MessageEntityBold,1650.0,129.0,MessageEntityBold,1958.0,227.0,MessageEntityBold,2931.0,337.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,530.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,530.0,,,,,MessageReplies,7.0,25478.0,False,[],,17129.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Responsible leadership would have already surrendered or at least entered peace negotiations, but it‚Äôs not about Ukraine ‚Äî if Ukraine had responsible leadership, there would be no conflict altogether. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èMany people in Russia, Ukraine and even rest of the world hoped that the bloodshed will end this year. It looked like that non-violent resolution was close in spring and Russia has even withdrawn its forces from some regions as a gesture of goodwill. However, it turned out that Kiev regime was using negotiations to win time to mobilize people and secure weapon supplies from the West. As soon as they managed to do it, they immediately came with Bucha provocation sacrificing their own citizens for an excuse to withdraw from negotiations.

‚ñ™Ô∏èEver since spring the Ukrainian side backed by a notorious alliance of neocons and neoliberals in the United States has been denying reality and refusing any kind of talks with Russia. For several months until August Russia was still hoping that forces of reason in Ukraine will prevail and that Ukrainian people will overthrow the criminal regime that dragged them to this war. This did not happen. On the contrary, semi-fascist regime has strengthened its grip over Ukrainian people and started talking of its victory emboldened by seemingly endless supplies from their Western patrons.

By autumn Ukraine managed to mobilize a huge army on Western money and enjoyed some local successes. This made Zelensky and his cronies even more impudent and so-called leader of Ukraine has completely dismissed the idea of talks with Russia. Ever since then crazy addicts that took over Kiev have been absolutely confident in their victory. They did not worry that Ukraine got bankrupt back in summer, they did not worry about lives of their people and they did everything they could to escalate the conflict. 

Naturally, Russia did not sit idle and Russian Armed Forces got serious in face of terrorist attacks arranged by Ukraine and the collective West. While still trying sparing civilians, Russia resorted to missile and drone strikes against Ukrainian military facilities and dual-purpose infrastructure. These strikes were incredibly successful and any other country would get to its senses, but getting to senses is not about Ukraine. Zelensky‚Äôs government cannot be even called a government, it‚Äôs more like a colonial administration that strictly follows orders of its American masters.

Even now, when Ukrainian energy grid is almost completely disabled, people suffer from cold and hunger, combat units have lowest morale and Western backers are running out of supplies, Zelensky and Co. are sticking to their previous starting position ‚Äî Ukraine is the winner. 

Although Russia is ready to return to negotiation table, Ukrainian preconditions are a product of a drugged mind that is very far from reality. This means that we won‚Äôt leave this conflict in 2022 and it will continue to 2023. If fascist wimps don‚Äôt want negotiations, there will be no negotiations.

While the majority of Greek population is strongly against the idea, there still is a sizeable minority that sees it as a retaliation measure for supply of Russian S-400s to Turkey. 

üî∫Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis comes from a prominent dynasty of Greek politicians, his father also held the post of Prime Minister of Greece in 1990s and his great uncle, Eleftherios Venizelos, was one of the most prominent and famous Greek politicians in the first half of the 20th century and held Prime Minister seat from 1910 to 1933 with a number of breaks. Mitsotakis is firmly set in the camp of US neoliberals and is likely to move on with this plan just to please them.

Naturally, this supply would be a violation of the contract and will probably deal the final blow to relations between Russia and Greece. While our countries share Orthodox faith and legacy of Byzantine culture and while most Greek people are genuinely friendly to Russians, this matter is decided by politicians who care about their current objectives and not of their long-term consequences. 

Greece has been more supportive of Ukraine ever since the coup in 2014 and there is a good reason for it. The infamous Geoffrey R. Pyatt who was US ambassador in Ukraine in times of Maidan has been transferred to Athens afterwards and efficiently promoted US interests in Greece right until this summer.

While income from tourism is an important part of Greek budget and a large part of it was attributed to Russian tourists, Greece did not defend its interests with this regard and still took a side in the conflict. While Greek church is not a part of state, it also took the side of Ukrainian church during the split which recently culminated in seizure of assets of Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Moscow Patriarchy including Kiev-Pechersk Lavra. 

Russia has already warned Greece that supply of S-300 systems to Ukraine will have consequences, and those consequences are definitely going to be dire for Greece. In fact, for last decade Russia has acted as a restraining factor in Turkish ambitions with regard to Greek world. While Russia did supply Erdogan with S-400 batteries, it maintained some control and could ensure that they are not used in case of open conflict between Greece and Turkey. If Greece sends this kind of military aid to Ukraine, Russia will no longer have any incentives to defend it. 

Supplies of weapons to Ukraine in spring were met with protests in Greek society and Greek government has been more or less silent about further help ever since. Nonetheless, Mitsotakis is a part of neoliberal globalist block, so he is still likely to make the decision that will ruin the relations between Russia and Greece for a very long time.

The supply of S-300 batteries to Ukraine will not play a decisive role for the conflict ‚Äî Ukraine had a lot of them and most of their older batteries are already down. Yes, modernized versions from Greece are undoubtedly better than what Ukraine but even if they are supplied with full stock of missiles, it will just delay Ukrainian defeat but not prevent it.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1888.0,2.0,2022-12-28T09:02:29+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,256.0,MessageEntityBold,749.0,137.0,MessageEntityBold,1450.0,609.0,MessageEntityBold,2808.0,360.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,528.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,528.0,,,,,MessageReplies,14.0,25478.0,False,[],,17346.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The meeting took place at the Presidential Library and was attended by leaders of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. 

Russian leader welcomed the decision of CIS member states to proclaim 2023 the year of Russian language. Next year will see a lot of activities to support the Russian language and increase its status as international communication language.

""Our nations have very many ties: common history, spiritual roots, deep integration of cultures, values and traditions and, of course, Russian language that is a powerful force joining our multi-ethnic states‚Äù, - said the President. 

At the moment Russian language has the status of state language in Russia and Belarus and the status of official language in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. It has also some official status in autonomies of Moldova, which was notably absent at the meeting. Moldova has suspended its participation in CIS a little more than a month ago under the pressure of its pro-Western elites that still dream of entering EU and were recently awarded candidate status. Still, moods in Moldavian society are mixed and it‚Äôs likely that it‚Äôs just a game aimed to get a gas discount.

While CIS by itself is a very loose block, it served as a backbone for Collective Security Treaty Organization and Eurasian Economic Union, which are much more advanced projects that offer tighter integration opportunities.

As the leading country of CSTO and EAU, Russia has some weight to promote its initiatives related to Russian language. Russia needs to expand its influence and with regard to that it‚Äôs very important to promote the status of Russian language and maybe even tie it with economic benefits. 

In Soviet times Russian language has been the lingua franca of Eastern Europe and the entire USSR. It had the role of inter-ethnic communication language and this role can still be restored, at least on a more limited scale. CIS spans ten countries with total population about 250 million and expanded use of Russian language will strengthen ties of those countries with Russia. Russian remains the language of science and engineering in most of CIS states and opens them a way to get familiar with rich Russian cultural heritage.

‚ñ™Ô∏èNot so long ago CIS had two more countries ‚Äî Georgia and Ukraine. These countries have left CIS for a reason, and while Georgia has returned to the path of reconciliation after disappointment with Western puppeteers who attempted to turn it into what is now Ukraine. It took time, but Georgia is gradually returning to pragmatic relations with Russia as its only large trade partner. 

Territorial conflicts are still there and they still need to be resolved but it is quite possible that after successful resolution of Ukrainian conflict in favor of Russia, Georgia will quickly come up with better proposals that will end the feud that lasts for more than three decades and will finalize the status of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. 

As for Ukraine, the language issue is one of the main reasons for the present conflict. Semi-fascist regime sponsored by Western enemies of Russia did everything it could to fight Russian language in Ukraine. They succeeded it to an extent and removal of Russian language from schools resulted in ukrainization of a whole generation. 

Another importance of Russian language is that its speakers can understand and promote Russian point of view and debunk propaganda coming from the collective West. It‚Äôs not just about Ukraine ‚Äî there are seeds of color revolutions in many CIS countries. To counter them, Russia needs to increase its soft power and promoting Russian language is very important for this.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2048.0,5.0,2022-12-28T07:41:23+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,0.0,2.0,MessageEntityBold,3.0,297.0,MessageEntityItalic,542.0,209.0,MessageEntityBold,764.0,164.0,MessageEntityBold,1340.0,225.0,MessageEntityBold,1855.0,98.0,MessageEntityBold,2389.0,386.0,MessageEntityBold,3123.0,208.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,527.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,527.0,,,,,MessageReplies,1.0,25478.0,False,[],,17031.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was a hard and challenging year for Russian economy, but it managed to overcome the difficulties and did not collapsed as it was expected by traitorous Western countries that broke all their agreements and written and unwritten guarantees. 

How did Russia manage to survive the unprecedented sanctions, restriction of access to global markets and unlawful obstacles created to its foreign trade? The thing is that Russia has been living under sanctions for years and those sanctions were gradually getting harsher and harsher. 

As soon as Western countries were ready, they imposed a new package of sanctions on made-up pretext of Russian involvement in Ukrainian conflict. Russian SMO triggered activation of all sanctions they could impose, but this time a large part of the West was not prepared for it and suffered much more than Russia. 

Those sanctions would still come sooner or later and they indeed could strangle Russia if the West had more time to prepare for them. One of the last strokes was the idea of imposing sanctions on Russia for ‚Äúinvasion of Ukraine‚Äù last December. Sanctioning a country for something that has not happened yet has shown Russia that it‚Äôs better to face everything at once while it will still hurt the opponents than wait until they completely displace Russia on global economy.

This response of the collective West was expected. Import substitution initiatives were already in place and Russia did become economically independent from the West in the most critical areas. 

Thanks to very successful import substitution in agriculture Russia remains the world‚Äôs largest grain exporter. Restrictions of shipping and insurance did create problems with transportation, but importers of Russian food are as interested in removing those restrictions as Russia and it is just a matter of time. Without these initiatives Russians could just starve. 

In last eight years Russia managed to establish its own internal payment system and infrastructure for bank cards. Without that, withdrawal of Visa/Mastercard and SWIFT would effectively paralyze Russian economy. Returning to cash transactions and last century wire transfer technologies could collapse Russian consumer market. 

Details of Russian defense industry are not public, but we see that all needs of the special military operation are being met, Russia does not run out of ammunition, missiles or anything else, despite endless forecasts of Western and Ukrainian sources. Had Russian defense industry been dependent on any imports, these forecasts could turn true. 

While import substitution was not yet completed in many less critical fields, the plans were already in place and all it took to put them in work was the political decision to start the special military operation in Ukraine. 

Mikhail Mishustin personally oversaw import substitution projects in microelectronic field and while the details are not disclosed, Vladimir Putin has greatly praised his achievements earlier this month and appointed him and Andrey Belousov (an extremely competent economist) to oversee those projects that were not so successful.

Appointment of Mishustin‚Äôs government was the critically important factor that helped Russia to withstand sanction pressure. Of course, if not for those sanctions, COVID and SMO, their economical projects and policies could have restarted double-digit economic growth in Russia, but well, that is yet to come. Russia has successfully survived the hardest time and after victory in Ukraine it will emerge as a new economic challenger to globalist order of the collective West.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2370.0,6.0,2022-12-26T11:45:41+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,0.0,2.0,MessageEntityBold,3.0,275.0,MessageEntityBold,566.0,145.0,MessageEntityBold,1356.0,308.0,MessageEntityBold,1922.0,115.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,526.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,526.0,,,,,MessageReplies,17.0,25478.0,False,[],,17057.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They don‚Äôt understand why can‚Äôt Russians or Chinese just get along with the West and make money like countries like Germany, Poland, Japan or Sweden. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èIt‚Äôs simple. The Germans, Poles, Japanese and Swedes are interested in their well-being more than in their sovereignty. While some of them object to Western values and woke culture, they still have to embrace and accept them. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èEconomic benefits come together with political and cultural requirements and those economic benefits for countries of the collective West are often ethereal. The United States view European Union as their own playground and always put their own interests above European interests. The entire economic burden of sanctions against Russia in 2022 rests on shoulders of Europeans. Americans just profit on European problems and see nothing wrong about it. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èCountries like Russia and China prefer following their own culture and traditions instead of embracing woke liberalism and universal US culture. Life is a bit easier for China as it has already realized its economic potential and managed to become the first economy in the world.

Russia still has to restore its own economic potential and if Russia wants to preserve its sovereignty, this requires economic expansion. Eurasian Union is the Russian economic expansion project and it was progressing well until clashing with EU‚Äôs economic expansion project. 

EAU is still moving on but losing the critical country for its success has definitely stalled its development. With Ukraine it could quickly achieve the economic level of USSR without many Soviet flaws.

Countries like Germany, Poland, Japan and Sweden are part of US/EU economic expansion project. In last decade Germany looked as if it had some ambitions to split away as leader of EU block and make it less dependent on the U.S. However, the events of this year have crossed this out. Things could have played differently but challenging U.S. would take a strong leader caring solely about interests of his people and Germany doesn‚Äôt have one.

Countries like Japan and South Korea don‚Äôt have any real alternative to being in U.S. economic block as they are unable to compete with China and even with each other in their geographical region and China won‚Äôt accept them as partners in its own economic integration projects for historic reasons.

Russian and Chinese foreign policies are rational. In modern world large countries need markets to export their goods and to grow their economy. China has sufficient internal market for self-propelled growth, so its economic expansion is less hasty, more well-thought and goes smoother than for Russia. 

Russia doesn‚Äôt have sufficient internal market and its location does not give it many options for economic expansion. Bringing large countries in your economic block is a hard and long process and those countries have to be friendly to you and aligned with your goals.

The UN Food and Agriculture organization has been created to fight global hunger and help developing countries improve their agriculture and food independence. 

As elections of the new chairman are nearing, the Western media has initiated a wave of hate publications against Qu Dongyu, former vice minister of agriculture and rural development of China. They accuse him of many things and the main accusation sounds as ‚Äúreluctance to condemn Russia for invasion of Ukraine‚Äù. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èChinese representative was elected almost four years ago mainly because he ran against competing candidates from Europe and the USA. During his term he did a lot to really improve situation with food safety in poorest countries of the world. However, he rarely hesitated to speak against the narrative of the collective West.

‚ÄúYou are looking at money, I‚Äôm looking to change the business model because I‚Äôm a farmer of small poor, family. You from the rich countries, you consider the money first, I consider wisdom first. It‚Äôs a different mentality"". This kind of statements made Qu Dongyu unpopular among Western elites because they see them as blasphemy and an attempt to disrupt neo-colonial model that is one of the cornerstones of Western prosperity. 

This year FAO desperately tried to stay out of politics and avoided speaking against Russia despite unprecedented pressure of the Western members. It played an important role in the famous ‚Äúgrain deal‚Äù and Chinese chairman tried to do his best to help it work. He tried to act in the interested of poor countries instead of appeasing the collective West and that enraged the Western media.

However, FAO is not the only UN organization responsible for food distribution. It has a competing agency, WFP (World Food Programme) that has been tightly controlled by U.S. for a very long time and does not step an inch from the ‚Äúparty line‚Äù of Washington establishment. 

It is likely that Europe and US will now nominate a single candidate for FAO chairman post. They will surely continue their slander campaign full of racist remarks, accusations of bias and claims of blasphemous idea to help countries grow food instead of just doing some charity. 

In any case, the countries that Qu will likely count on to be re-elected are not so interested in the political machinations of the West or its condemnation of the Russia's war in Ukraine, which it seeks to impress upon FAO's top leadership. The third world has to make a say here.

This situation is not unique. The collective West puts unprecedented pressure on all other UN agencies that are supposed to be out of politics and above any conflicts. Attempts of the collective West to turn UN into a closed club for themselves are diminishing UN role in the world and undermining its authority, which was not so high to begin with.

UN reforms are long due and maybe the present conflict between Russia and the collective West will ultimately result either in collapse of UN or in its deep reforms and transformation to a really impartial organization working for global benefit.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2403.0,5.0,2022-12-23T11:07:42+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,0.0,2.0,MessageEntityBold,3.0,239.0,MessageEntityItalic,887.0,223.0,MessageEntityBold,1112.0,207.0,MessageEntityBold,1710.0,275.0,MessageEntityBold,2550.0,351.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,522.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,522.0,,,,,MessageReplies,3.0,25478.0,False,[],,17106.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ten months have passed since the onset of the Special Military Operation of Russian Armed Forces in Ukraine. 

Situation on Ukrainian front is a common knowledge, but it is not the only front. SMO marked a new stage in conflict between globalist vision of the collective West and vision of independent countries that want to maintain their sovereignty, culture and traditions and to develop their own way without following woke patterns.

Military aspect of the operation was secondary from the very onset. The main part of the conflict was going in different dimensions. Ten months is sufficiently long period of time to watch for intermediate results, so let‚Äôs see what has Russia gained.

‚¨úÔ∏è Russia managed to undermine the global faith in US dollar. While in the beginning of the year the whole world was skeptical about the possibility of that, in November and December international deals in rubles, rupees and yuan became a routine deal.

‚¨úÔ∏è Russia managed to undermine global faith in Western democracy and freedom. The West has shown their true face by blatantly manipulating public opinion, censoring Russian channels and attempting to shut down any information sources that contradict their narrative.

‚¨úÔ∏è Russia managed to undermine the global faith in Western financial institutions. The collective West has shown their true face by freezing Russian assets, which is now becoming a trend. Even firm allies of the US in the third world are now worried about what can happen if they displease the hegemon. 

‚¨úÔ∏è Russia managed to give a kickstart to a new world order with more and more countries drifting to BRICS and its alternative economic projects aiming to steer away from the collective West that ties economic benefits with demands to embrace Western culture and Western values no matter how alien they are to the country in question. 

‚¨úÔ∏è Russia managed to split a crack between U.S. and its EU allies. In face of energy crisis the U.S. has turned to prey on Europe and not all Europeans are happy about it. Moreover, the U.S. is aiming to lure European industry to the Western hemisphere and impotent EU leaders can do little to oppose that.

‚¨úÔ∏è Russia managed to undermine the global faith in American and European defense industries. It turned out that they are not able to sustain even a second-rate military conflict against a strong adversary without stripping off reserve supplies of their own military forces. 

‚¨úÔ∏è Russia managed to survive the hardest blow that the collective West could deal ‚Äî unprecedented economic sanctions, severance of trade ties and withdrawal of a large part of Western companies from Russia. Moreover, economic consequences for Russia are much less than those suffered by the West. 

Inevitable victory of Russian forces in Ukraine will mark a new stage of the conflict when new strong Russia will no longer be alone but will feel full support of those countries that share its vision of the future.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2281.0,9.0,2022-12-23T10:06:06+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,0.0,2.0,MessageEntityBold,3.0,278.0,MessageEntityBold,677.0,185.0,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,862.0,2.0,MessageEntityBold,865.0,58.0,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,1116.0,2.0,MessageEntityBold,1118.0,75.0,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,1384.0,2.0,MessageEntityBold,1387.0,79.0,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,1689.0,2.0,MessageEntityBold,1692.0,333.0,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,2025.0,2.0,MessageEntityBold,2028.0,63.0,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,2333.0,2.0,MessageEntityBold,2336.0,88.0,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,2609.0,2.0,MessageEntityBold,2612.0,203.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,521.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,521.0,,,,,MessageReplies,7.0,25478.0,False,[],,16956.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The President has noted achievements of the special military operation and stated several important areas of note: 

‚¨úÔ∏è Information about NATO forces and equipment must be analyzed and used to improve capabilities of Russian armed forces and special services. The experience obtained within the course of special military operation should be integrated in training of officers, strategic planning programs and military supply systems. 

‚¨úÔ∏è The Ministry of Defense has to work within the framework of the Coordination Council with other state agencies, regional leaders and defense industry. Combat trial of equipment is extremely important and engineers have to watch real use of their machines to distinguish good features and features that require improvements. 

‚¨úÔ∏è It is important to remain combat readiness of Russian nuclear triad and continuously improve it. It is the main guarantee of Russian sovereignty and territorial integrity, parity and balance of power in the world. 

Strategic Rocket Forces keep transition to hypersonic Avanguard warheads, Sarmat missiles will enter combat duty very soon despite slight delay, Yars missile systems are being supplied to units. Russia will continue development of unique, truly unique hypersonic missile systems. New ‚ÄúAdmiral Gorshkov‚Äù frigate armed with truly unique Zircon missiles will be launched in early January.

‚¨úÔ∏è It is important to expand capabilities of Aerospace Force in zones covered by modern air defense systems, especially those of fighter jets and bombers. 

A very important task is to develop and improve UAVs including strategic, surveillance and strike drones. SMO experience has shown that UAVs are useful everywhere and must be present on the level combat units, platoons, companies and battalions. 

Target detection and transmission of data for strike must be instant. UAVs must be integrated into a tight network with secure communication channels enabling connection to staff offices and commanders. 

All necessary needs of combat units must be met. All personnel must have modern, convenient and reliable equipment and supplies based on their real needs. There is no restriction of financing for the army.

‚¨úÔ∏è It is necessary improve control and communication system to ensure sustainable and operative control of forces in any conditions. Expand use of AI technologies on all decision-making levels. Experience of the past months shows that most efficient weapon systems are those systems that function rapidly and in almost automatic mode.

The President also covered the issue of mobilization and noted the need for modernization of enlistment offices. Moreover, he explained that 150,000 of the recently mobilized recruits that are currently undergoing training will be actually used as reserves. Therefore, no second wave of mobilization should be expected in near future. 

In general, speech of the Russian President was full of confidence and optimism. He was not afraid to acknowledge some deficiencies and areas that need improvement and this acknowledgment made his words about successes in other fields even more valuable.

Let‚Äôs hope that the Ministry of Defense will immediately act on the orders of the President.

That is happening because perception depends on the narrative and the narrative is something that can be manipulated. The collective West has their own objectives about Ukraine and these objectives are threatening the very existence of Russian state while having nothing to do with well-being of Ukrainian people.

‚ñ™Ô∏èThe narrative of global media is just a tool to shape public opinion in the collective West and rest of the world, and it is adjusted towards goals of its real leaders.

If it was not Russia but NATO that attacked Ukraine, we would see global condemnation of human rights violations, corruption, neo-Nazi endorsement by Ukraine, lack of democracy and everything else you can imagine. We would see Lloyd Ostin shaking a vial of ‚Äúdeadly virus from Ukrainian biolabs‚Äù in UN, we would see Zelensky‚Äôs speech in Munich as an attempt of a fascist dictator to procure nuclear weapons that must be prevented at all costs. There is a good chance we would see this if 2014 coup in Ukraine had failed.

NATO and the West are very good in PR and spreading their narrative across the world. This time they have a great partner as Ukrainian president is also a real master of PR and helps them a great deal to create the picture of innocent Ukraine being attacked by evil Russian orcs seeking rape, plunder and murder.

Unfortunately, Russia is not as good in this sphere. Our instinctive disdain to manipulative technologies makes it harder to resist them. We don‚Äôt create nice pictures, we don‚Äôt invent fascinating plots ‚Äî we are just telling the truth without trying to tinsel it. This is a noble approach but it doesn‚Äôt work well in modern world. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èThe collective West does not acknowledge Russian primary objective of the special military operation ‚Äî denazification of Ukraine and protection of innocent people of Donbass. 

It looks as if those who speak for Ukraine now have never noticed what has been going on there in last eight years and what is still going there now. 

üî∫ Neo-Nazism is not about maniacs with Nazi tattoos, it‚Äôs much more than that. It‚Äôs the idea of ethnic superiority, ‚ÄúUkraine above all‚Äù. It‚Äôs the idea of ethnic cleansing - ‚ÄúKnives to Muscovites‚Äù. It‚Äôs the idea of forced change of identity: ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt need Russians here - identify as Ukrainian or leave‚Äù. 
Neo-Nazism is not necessarily about antisemitism. Russians are the new Jews in Ukraine. 

The collective West ignores all of this and promotes their narrative around the world. It is time for Russia to fight back, learn from the enemy and promote truth ‚Äî because bitter truth is still better than sweet lies.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1749.0,12.0,2022-12-22T10:09:14+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,295.0,MessageEntityBold,613.0,169.0,MessageEntityBold,2279.0,179.0,MessageEntityBold,2613.0,49.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,517.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,517.0,,,,,MessageReplies,8.0,25478.0,False,[],,17210.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Initially it was thought that direct NATO interference may turn the tide of this conflict. However, recent news about the state of German military with their faulty equipment and artillery give grounds to think that Europe has already invested all it could in Ukraine and that any further commitments will just leave Europe defenseless. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èThis week has also seen news that Polish military is turning into strongest in EU, Polish mercenaries fight and die in Ukraine in thousands and there are strong rumors about Poland preparing annexation of West Ukrainian regions. Polish people are not very happy about it and strongly stand against the idea to go dying for ‚ÄúGreater Poland‚Äù and especially for US hegemony. 

After Polish Defense Ministry announced plans to call 200 thousand reservists for ‚Äúmilitary training‚Äù, many Poles fled the country while many others have started protesting near military enlistment offices. 

No matter if rumors about Polish annexation are true or not, it‚Äôs worth to discuss the future of Ukraine after Russian victory.

‚ñ™Ô∏èThe present conflict started in 2014 and it started for a specific reason ‚Äî overthrow of Ukrainian government against the will of half of the country. Coup d‚Äôetat has put an end to the short-lived history of independent Ukraine.

Declaration of independence of DPR and LPR was based on one simple foundation ‚Äî if some regions are not allowed to have a say, they are no longer obliged to be a part of the state that ignores their will. Back in 2014 there was a chance for more regions to declare their independence on the same grounds. However, new Ukrainian authorities crushed this chance with terror methods (like in Odessa) and through shady deals with regional leaders (as in Kharkiv). 

‚ñ™Ô∏èThere are several options to reconfigure Ukraine after Russian victory. 

There is an option is to run referendums in Russian-speaking regions of Ukraine and make them finally decide their future. However, Kiev regime did a lot to incite hate against Russia in these regions, so the results would be unclear. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èMoreover, if a significant part of population won‚Äôt support return to Russia, it may create serious problems for Russian control of these territories and increased risk of terrorist activities from ‚Äúnew Russian citizens‚Äù. 

There will be also a big issue of former AFU soldiers from those regions who fought against Russian Armed Forces. Will these people be able to live a regular life as Russian citizens? 

However, instead of referendums Russia could try to revive the idea of people republics and turn Russian-speaking regions of Ukraine into separate states. Since Kherson and Zaporozhye became a part of Russia after September referendums, it would rather be a revival of Kharkov and Odessa republics. 

This idea will be quite popular in South Ukraine. People of Odessa and Nikolaev are angry with Russia, but they equally blame Kiev and Zelensky regime for their suffering. Letting these regions create an independent republic will create another buffer territory between Russia and hostile Europe and will create good chances for reconciliation and its reintegration into Russian world. Situation with Kharkov and Dnepropetrovsk is similar.

As for the rest of Ukraine, they should be left on their own to do whatever they like. Maybe central Ukrainian regions could also undertake referendums about their future, but as a whole ‚Äì if they want Europe ‚Äì let them go to Europe, be it as a part of Poland or as an ‚Äúeternal candidate‚Äù or whatever. It‚Äôs a pity to lose old Russian city of Kiev, but its people have chosen their fate.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1702.0,5.0,2022-12-22T08:47:03+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,512.0,MessageEntityBold,1100.0,129.0,MessageEntityBold,1923.0,76.0,MessageEntityBold,2236.0,226.0,MessageEntityBold,3390.0,386.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,516.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,516.0,,,,,MessageReplies,5.0,25478.0,False,[],,17209.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ukrainian commander in chief Zaluzhny has published a video addressed to Zelensky where he urges to impose harsher punishment for disobedience and desertion of Ukrainian soldiers. He stated that this is becoming a serious problem and that AFU has to replace forces with low morale, which results in territorial losses and increased casualties.

Looks like the Ukrainian military has no other way than to acknowledge continuous fall of morale and call for harsher measures against Ukrainian soldiers that are not willing to die for arrogance of Zelensky and Nazi dreams. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èUkraine has undertaken many waves of mobilization to replenish incredibly high losses of AFU with poorly trained recruits. New Russian tactics emphasizing destruction of enemy manpower have yielded its results and even brainwashed Ukrainian conscripts are getting a bit sober in face of certain death. 

As quality of AFU soldiers goes down, Ukrainian tactics of sending human waves in desperate attempts to hold doomed defense positions results in more and more losses. However, neither AFU generals nor Zelensky look ready to accept the reality ‚Äî Ukraine has already lost. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èElite Nazi battalions and mercenaries try to avoid combat losses and usually act as blocking detachments forcing conscripts from East Ukraine to fight against their will. 

Why is Kiev regime doing this? They need to present their sponsors a picture of successes, a picture of impenetrable defense. Their main objective is not victory, their main objective is to secure as much financial and military aid from the West as possible and they don‚Äôt hesitate to sacrifice any number of Ukrainian citizens for this purpose.

‚ñ™Ô∏èHowever, these sacrifices are very selective. Latest waves of mobilization were mainly focused on East and South Ukraine, areas with Russian-speaking population. This serves another objective of Kiev regime ‚Äî eliminate all potential opposition. 

Continuous brainwashing of Russian-speaking Ukrainians did produce some results, but Zelensky‚Äôs regime is still afraid that one day they will get sober and see the truth. That is why those East Ukrainians are sent to die. More deaths result in lower chances of internal unrest and more seeds of hate between Russian and Ukrainian nations. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èEven at the moment of their defeat Russophobes are doing everything they can to weaken pro-Russian sentiment and prevent inevitable expansion of the Russian world. Their propaganda keeps blaming Russia for everything ignoring the fact that Russians are not sending them to die and that Russia has given Ukrainians enough time to see who are their real enemies. 

The situation is unfortunate for Russian-speaking part of Ukraine, but Russia should not refrain itself. Increasing levels of desertion and insubordination are a good sign that AFU resistance will sooner or later collapse and every day makes this collapse closer. 

Recent Russian strikes on groups of foreign mercenaries are also yielding results. Once mercenaries flee and morale of forces at the front reaches its lows, even blocking detachments won‚Äôt help Kiev regime to prevent ultimate Russian victory.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1829.0,3.0,2022-12-21T16:08:53+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,460.0,MessageEntityBold,690.0,124.0,MessageEntityBold,1269.0,175.0,MessageEntityBold,1791.0,249.0,MessageEntityBold,2381.0,165.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,515.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,515.0,,,,,MessageReplies,2.0,25478.0,False,[],,17208.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Radio ‚ÄúLiberty‚Äù, (recognized in Russia as a foreign agent) a media outlet sponsored by the U.S., has recently published an article titled ""Russia strikes Ukrainian infrastructure again"" and illustrated it with a photo of the aftermath of the Ukrainian army's strike on Donetsk. This is unprecedented level of cynicism but it goes in line with mass disinformation campaign launched by Ukraine and their sponsors at the collective West.

üî∫The article noticed by War on Fakes Telegram channel contains usual slander against the Russian Armed Forces that allegedly wants to create a humanitarian disaster in Ukraine. However, it doesn‚Äôt say a single word about daily attacks of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on cities in Donbas and other regions of Russia targeting almost exclusively civilian infrastructure.

üî∫Missile and drone strikes of the Russian Armed Forces on Ukraine's energy grid and other dual-purpose infrastructure are aimed to hinder operations of the Ukrainian army and defense industry. They never target purely civilian facilities and any such hits are the result of misfiring Ukrainian missile defense.

It is not the first and not the last time when Ukrainian war crimes are disguised as Russian. Numerous staged massacres combined with merciless and brutal murders of Ukrainian civilians have already been attributed to Russian Armed Forces contrary to any logic and common sense.

While all Russian atrocities are taken for granted by gentleman‚Äôs words of Kiev regime, the collective West and so called ‚Äúindependent institutions‚Äù are very reluctant to acknowledge even obvious war crimes done by Ukraine. 

Remember the story with shelling of Zaporozhye nuclear plant? It is still under fire. Russia is building a defense dome to prevent damage that can result in radioactive contamination, but IAEA keeps attributing attacks to ‚Äúunknown party‚Äù, while globalist media create a picture that it is done exclusively by Russia. Meanwhile a single explosion of allegedly Russian missile at safe distance from South Ukrainian Nuclear Plant have caused a spike of outrage in globalist media and enjoyed much greater coverage than routine attacks on ZNP.

üî∫Despite availability of numerous evidence of the contrary, Western media keeps accusing Russia of North Stream explosions and attack on Crimean bridge, not speaking of old fakes about Bucha, Irpen and so on. Even the court ruling old MH-17 story shows complete bias in favor of the Ukrainian side. 

Moreover, information about Russian responsibility for numerous war crimes committed by Ukraine is prevalent in Wikipedia, which is used by the entire world and is supposed to be de-facto encyclopedia. Russian point of view is virtually eradicated and even Russian-language part of Wikipedia is continuously edited by pro-Ukrainian information warriors with the aim of demonization of Russia.

This makes Russian initiative to create sovereign online encyclopedia ‚ÄúKnowledge‚Äù announced by Maksut Shadayev, Minister of Digital Development even more important.

Massive Russian strikes over Ukrainian energy grid with missiles and drones have virtually achieved their results. The power grid is down and this seriously hinders mobility of enemy forces, supplies and whatever is left of Ukrainian arms industry.

While Zelensky‚Äôs regime is trying to pretend that nothing serious has happened, they have already prohibited citizens talk about blackouts publicly. They pretend that those without electricity are a part of ‚Äúthe unfortunate 1 percent‚Äù. That‚Äôs their usual math, the one they use to calculate casualties, secure financial aid and so on. 

Kiev rulers are acting as if they have already secured victory, and this makes sense for them ‚Äî nobody will send money to losers and extracting money from the West is becoming the favorite sport of Zelensky and Co.

They are virtually forcing citizens to stay at cities without stable supply of power, hot water and central heating. They lie because they need to show a nice picture to their sponsors. We have always known that well-being of civilians has zero relevance to Kiev regime, they have already proven it with there endless shelling of Donbass. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èBy the way, that shelling still continues ‚Äî while people in the West were watching FIFA World Cup, Ukrainian artillery have launched a massive strike against civilian hospital in Donetsk that involved casualties. It was just the last of the series of similar strikes against residential buildings, temples, cafes and other civilian infrastructure. 

These strikes have no military sense, there were no military objects or armed forces in the vicinity of impacted areas. In fact, they perfectly fit definition of war crime. Moreover, Ukraine still claims Donetsk to be its territory but it does not have any concerns about people that it wants to return‚Ä¶ or not. In fact, it‚Äôs common knowledge that Ukraine just wants those rich lands, no people needed. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èThe Ukrainian regime enforces ‚Äústay home‚Äù agenda for several reasons, and the main reason is that if Zelensky allows people to leave, Ukraine will get empty. EU will face another migration crisis while it hasn‚Äôt even barely accommodated to the previous one. Several more millions of Ukrainian migrants in EU will inevitably cause an explosion among local people and they will start looking for someone responsible. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èZelensky is too minor figure to answer for all European problems but his helpers are still around ‚ÄîEU parliament, EU government, leaders of EU countries. All those proponents of ‚Äúsolidarity with Ukraine‚Äù who decided that a chance for a victorious war is worth suffering of their people. No way.

So, Ukrainian energy grid is down. Zelensky regime may extend its agony by a couple more weeks with help of Europeans, so Russian pressure has to continue. Next priority targets are air defense, supply lines and fuel facilities. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èThe greater is the Russian pressure, the higher is the chance that Zelensky will no longer be able to hide the truth from his sponsors and, more importantly, from his people.

Henry Kissinger, a ninety-nine-year-old veteran of international politics, published an article in the Spectator, where he proposed his own solution of the Ukrainian crisis. His proposal can be viewed as a sign of what the collective West can offer Russia, and for now this is only one thing ‚Äî international recognition of status quo before February. This is absolutely unacceptable to Russia and a seasoned diplomat deeply respected by Putin could offer something more realistic.

It is unclear whether the collective West understands that its offers are futile and whether they are objectively assessing the situation in Ukraine. Such offers should not be coming in view of imminent collapse of Ukrainian state. It would sound as if Hitler proposed to return to 1939 borders in 1945.

Moreover, this offer like all previous Western offers concentrate on territorial issues. Looks like they don‚Äôt see that Russian primary objective in Ukraine is not territorial expansion of the Russian Federation but denazification of Ukrainian state as none of their ‚Äúpeace plans‚Äù cover this issue. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èWhat kind of proposal would be acceptable to Russia? Russian terms are well known and they include much more than acknowledgment of referendums in new Russian regions. However, Russia does not refuse to talk without any preliminary conditions. So maybe instead of voicing half-hearted proposals through retired diplomats, the West should indeed start talking. 

üî∫For starters, Western powers have to cease supplies of weapons and ammunition to Kiev regime and withdraw all their military personnel from the territory of former Ukrainian SSR. Ukrainian troops have to lay down weapons and withdraw from territory of new regions of the Russian Federation. All attacks against Russian military forces and civilians have to be stopped.

üî∫However, even this will not be enough. The Ukrainian crisis has to be solved once and for all but it‚Äôs just a manifestation of the conflict between Russia and the West. European leaders are right when they speak about the need for new security framework in Europe and they are right that such a framework cannot exist without Russia. 

The very paradox of the situation is that NATO understands that it cannot win a conventional or unconventional war against Russia. They are pushing, trying to overstretch Russia, trying to incite a color revolution for regime change, trying to strangle Russia economically. However, they cannot resort to direct and open use of force because it will be the end of them as well. 

So, NATO-Russia talks are also a must and these talks should be aimed to discuss the future of NATO and its existence or dissolution in post-Ukrainian world.

What about talking to Ukraine? Well, Ukraine is not capable of negotiations and it is not an independent subject of the international policy. Ukraine has been defeated around August. Objectives of Kiev regime have nothing to do with well-being of Ukrainian people, desire for peace and long-term stability in the region.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2220.0,3.0,2022-12-19T10:20:44+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,44.0,MessageEntityBold,220.0,457.0,MessageEntityBold,1137.0,52.0,MessageEntityBold,2589.0,159.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,511.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,511.0,,,,,MessageReplies,12.0,25478.0,False,[],,17188.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yes, there is always a chance to find a path to reconciliation, even in the most dire circumstances and even after the most radical disagreements. Relations between geopolitical entities are not a matter of mutual sympathy but rather a matter of balance of interests and mutual trust. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èThe biggest obstacle to reset of West-Russian relations is definitely the loss of trust. Hypocritical nature of the collective West also creates some problems, and yet another issue stems from the very fact that the West is not a monolithic entity. Despite all of the collective West countries accepting leadership of the U.S., they still perceive themselves independent entities and keep asking ‚ÄúWhy us?‚Äù. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èWhy us? Was it Sweden that staged 2014 Maidan in Ukraine? Was it Italy that opened its NGOs in Central Asia? Was it Greece that placed biolabs in ex-USSR? Was it Finland what fueled the ‚ÄúRevolution of Roses‚Äù and endorsed Georgian leader‚Äôs dream to get to NATO at all costs? 

Of course, not. Countries of the ‚Äúcollective West‚Äù include Japan, South Korea, Australia and some other countries that are not part of the West. They rejected collective responsibility for actions of the Western block. It was all about Americans. 

Russia seemed to accept that approach but 2022 changed everything. Collective sanctions against Russia became a clear indicator of that. Revelations of German ex-chancellor Angela Merkel about bogey nature of Minsk agreements destroyed the trust completely. 

Without trust any reset of relations is a very hard process. Russia is the offended party and is actively pursuing its own purposes that no longer include the collective West. Will the West try to do it? Maybe yes. 

The initiative will most likely come from the USA. Despite their internal problems, the USA are still a great power, they are a sovereign country that can choose its foreign policy in accordance with its interests. They are still strong enough to acknowledge their mistakes.

EU has transformed into some amorphous swamp and is not respected anymore. Not in Moscow, not in Beijing, not in Washington. EU bureaucrats guided by some unclear motives are demolishing their relation with neighboring energy supplier Russia up to have their aggregated parliament qualify it as state sponsor of terrorism. 

The USA, on the contrary refrain to cut all bridges and even keep negotiating with Russia on their mutual interests, from the nukes to hostage exchanges. Moreover, 2024 is looming on the horizon and almost inevitable change of power in the United States may mark yet another turn in their foreign policy. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èWhen Russia emerges victorious and strong from the Ukrainian conflict, it will be able to deal with the USA as an equal and, more importantly, will be accepted as an equal. Might makes right, and this rule has not gone anywhere. 

It doesn‚Äôt mean that Russia and US will become allies, friends or partners. It just means that the U.S. will become an important part of an emerging world order.

The meeting covered many aspects of Russian development and laid out the framework of transforming Russia into an innovative modern country with lowest poverty level. 

The President has stressed that while poverty level is gradually going down, there is still a lot of work to do and that in addition to federal programs Russian regions also have to stimulate employment and new businesses. 

However, the most important part of his speech was covering the issue of foreign sanctions against Russia and achieving full technological and industrial sovereignty. 

‚ÄúAs it is well known, our country has been not just restricted but virtually rejected access to high-tech foreign products, things that are already global and form the base for progressive development of any country. They are trying to form obstacles to hinder Russian development. Naturally, this is a huge challenge for our country.

However, we are not going to give up, we won‚Äôt be overwhelmed by challenges and we won‚Äôt be thrown decades back in our development as foreshadowed by some of our adversaries. This won‚Äôt happen. On the contrary, we understand the colossal scope of difficulties that we are facing and intensively and diligently search for new solutions and efficiently use existing sovereign technologies and products developed by Russian innovative companies.‚Äù

üî∫ President Vladimir Putin has specified four areas that are critically important for innovative development of Russia: end-to-end technologies, digital transformation, adaptation of Russian financial system and improving education quality. 

While the area of end-to-end technologies is one of the most important, the progress has been limited. Some Russian state corporations achieved spectacular results, such as Sber in the field of AI, RZD in the field of quantum communications and Rosatom in the field of composite materials. However, Rostech has poor progress in such areas as 5G networks and IoT. Microelectronics project also had problems and was restarted in 2021. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èThe President proposed to assign a separate Vice Prime Minister responsible for each area and appointed Vice Prime Minister Andrey Belousov to manage the entire initiative under supervision of Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin who managed to reset the microchip industry development project with excellent results.

‚ñ™Ô∏èPresident noted progress in digital transformation and stated that it should cover every industry, every company, the entire social sphere, state and municipal administration, life of every person and every family.  

‚ñ™Ô∏èHe also spoke of the need to adapt Russian financial system to financing of innovative development. Previously Russian IT companies had to secure financing for their ambitious projects in foreign countries. It is no longer feasible, and Russian banks have to change their processes and loan policies for mutual benefit. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èFinally, the President stressed the need to improve the education system mentioning that by 2024 the country may face a deficit of one million IT specialists and not much less engineers. Vladimir Putin instructed the Ministry of Education to allocate more budget for training of this kind of specialists and to improve the material base of higher education institutions.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,1967.0,2.0,2022-12-17T12:09:36+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,129.0,MessageEntityBold,526.0,169.0,MessageEntityItalic,695.0,781.0,MessageEntityBold,1476.0,244.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,508.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,508.0,,,,,MessageReplies,0.0,25478.0,False,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mateusz Morawiecki spoke to journalists before European Council meeting in Brussels and said that Europe is currently looking for money to implement continuously postponed ‚Äúgas price cap‚Äù. According to Morawiecki, the EU should confiscate Russian oligarchs' assets to help Ukraine and European citizens.

""The money is there, it is USD 350 billion, with some suggesting it could be USD 400 billion, which could be used to reconstruct Ukraine and ease the consequences of the Russian aggression for European citizens,"" the prime minister said.

Last time when EU talked about frozen Russian money, they mentioned only Ukraine. Now they aim to ‚Äúease the consequences of the Russian aggression for European citizens.‚Äù What a nice way to say: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll steal this money no matter what‚Äù. Morawiecki naturally vouches for ‚Äúusing this money to help countries that host Ukrainian immigrants‚Äù as Poland is the top destination for Ukrainian.

‚ñ™Ô∏èThe initial sanctions in form of freezing foreign assets of the Russian Federation have already dealt a huge blow to world‚Äôs trust to the West. The United States are smart enough and rich enough to avoid talking about any kind of confiscation. However, Europe went all in about its crusade for self-destruction, and first signs of this are already manifesting ‚Äî they are getting low on money. Investors are reluctant to trust their assets to institutions that cannot guarantee safety of these assets. 

Three fourths of the world views anti-Russian sanctions as arbitrary and has rightful reasons to worry about similar sanctions being applied to their own countries shall they say anything against dictate of the collective West.

Back in September some of the most reputable global investment banks stopped recommending their customers to invest in EU stocks or bonds and proposed investment in America, China and emerging countries. 

By the way, it looks like Polish prime minister is once again trying to divide bear skin while the bear is still living. 

In recent interview to Estonian media Charles Lichfield, a senior finance expert at the Atlantic Council  said that United States and its European allies are unable to locate an estimated two-thirds or more of the Russian assets that they froze in a retaliatory response to Russia's military invasion of Ukraine in February. ‚Äú They just don‚Äôt know where exactly they the frozen funds are. 

The expert furthermore added that the EU and the US had, in actual, seized $80-$100 billion and not $300 billion Russian assets as was widely reported in the American media. The EU additionally froze $16.9 billion more in addition to the freezing previous assets in the Central Bank of Russia's foreign exchange reserves around the world. 

If the U.S. does not play along It means that Brussels actually has the capacity to confiscate about 8-10 times less than envisaged, and this won‚Äôt be nearly enough to compensate their expenses and losses. 

As for Ukraine, well, they were naturally dreaming how they will live a rich life on Russian money.

EU Parliament has finally noticed the looming economic problems and potential loss of competitiveness of European industry. On Thursday, December 15 they are planning to discuss measures that can be taken to address the dire situation that the EU faces in short-term, mid-term and long-term perspective. 

Sanctions against Russia can indeed be compared to shooting oneself in a leg. While Russia did not really notice their impact, Europe is now facing one of the hardest challenges for its economy in all its history. As energy prices have soared, more and more large European businesses are looking to move their industrial facilities overseas. 

The United States have longed opposed cooperation between Russia and Europe in energy sector. Inexpensive Russian pipeline gas brought European industry incredible competitive advantages that negated disadvantages of high cost of labor and high tax burden. Moreover, it enabled many European industries such as the car industry to successfully compete with American enterprises at foreign markets that the U.S. considers their own playground. 

Now Europe finally got rid of its dependence on ‚Äúnon-democratic‚Äù Russian gas, and is no longer dependent on Russia. According to recent revelations of Werner Steinecker, ex-CEO of Austrian Energie AG, EU has signed 20-year LNG supply contracts with the United States based on ‚Äútake or pay‚Äù formula that met such a harsh critics in Europe when it was used by Russia.

This means that European Union will have to pay the United States any ‚Äúmarket price‚Äù just to meet their basic demands. Costs of energy are already rising and they are not so noticeable by European consumers only because of government subsidies. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èMoreover, U.S. subsidies of their own industry may deal the last stroke to competitiveness of Europe although their long-term impact on U.S. economy is also controversial. European countries have little to do in response except for taking similar measures. 

France has proposed unrestricted subsidies to European industrial enterprises and this proposal is supported by many other EU countries with notable exception of Scandinavia that suffers less from the energy crisis. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èThe problem with industrial subsidies is that while they can give short-term boost to industry, they are not viable in long term. Subsidies can help create new industries, subsidies can help in production of critical things, but they cannot make industry competitive. 

European subsidies will effectively mean that European industry will yield losses to subsidizing countries. Competitiveness means low costs and European states will have to pay all the time to keep those costs low or face exodus of industry to other regions. This will put an end to relative wealth of the European Union.

üî¥ Is there another way? Sure, they can resume their contracts with Russia. Will Russia agree on that? Unlikely. Too many things have been said and done to make it easy. Europe will have to pay if it wants to restore ties. Russia will not come begging for mercy, but if Europe will, they still have a chance to save themselves from turning into a third world region.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1998.0,4.0,2022-12-16T11:16:16+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,48.0,MessageEntityBold,175.0,182.0,MessageEntityBold,435.0,134.0,MessageEntityBold,1146.0,367.0,MessageEntityBold,2511.0,352.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,506.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,506.0,,,,,MessageReplies,2.0,25478.0,False,[],,16775.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The decision has yet to be approved by U.S. Secretary of Defense and President Biden but there are no reasons to believe that such approval will be withheld.

Patriot battery consists of radar, computers, power generating equipment, engagement control station and up to eight launchers each holding four ready to fire missiles. Systems will allegedly be delivered to U.S. bases in Germany where Ukrainian operators will be trained to use them.

‚ñ™Ô∏èThis decision will definitely trigger many questions. First of all, a Patriot battery is not a simple system, it requires a dozens of trained personnel that have to work in coordination. Training such an operator is not a matter of days or even weeks, it would take months. Months is not something that Ukraine can afford, so training is likely to be a profanation and the systems will be actually operated by NATO military.

‚ñ™Ô∏èSecondly, there is the issue of generations. The U.S. does not specify age of the systems that will be supplied, type of missiles they are adapted to and their capabilities. Older generations of Patriots are worse than Soviet S-300 currently used by Ukraine, latest generation is slightly better but there is also the issue of numbers. One battery won‚Äôt change anything for Ukraine, just as ten or even twenty batteries. There is also an issue of price ‚Äî one battery costs $1 billion and one missile costs $3 million.

üî∫Do the U.S. have capability to supply a significant volume of missiles? The answer is no. U.S. doesn‚Äôt have enough Patriot missiles even for sale. When Saudi Arabia has depleted its stocks of missiles in Yemen conflict, they had to ask other Arab countries as the U.S. rejected the order. Lockheed Martin announced plans to increase missile production, however this expansion will take years and won‚Äôt match the numbers that Russia is producing per month.

üî∫Now, should Russia worry? Not really. Patriot systems have performed poorly in Saudi Arabia against missiles and drones used by Yemen. Even a hundred of such systems with full stocks of missiles for months would not guarantee Ukraine full protection. 

They are incompatible with Ukrainian air defense systems and can be operated only by NATO personnel. U.S. cannot really send many batteries and provide even remotely enough missiles to counter different types of cruise missiles, drones and decoys used by Russian military. 

Russian intelligence is not blind and surely Russian command understands what would be the impact of destroying US-supplied batteries and they will definitely be made priority targets. PAC 3 does have limited hypersonic interception capabilities, but it is much more likely that US batteries will just become a perfect target for testing latest Russian hypersonic missiles.  

U.S. command understands it as well, so it‚Äôs possible that those systems will never really get to Ukraine. If the U.S. will indeed train Ukrainian operators, it will take many months. Ukraine does not have this time. Or rather, Ukraine should not have this time and Russia has to take care of it.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1935.0,4.0,2022-12-14T13:10:08+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,305.0,MessageEntityBold,870.0,152.0,MessageEntityBold,1198.0,83.0,MessageEntityBold,1545.0,71.0,MessageEntityBold,2002.0,27.0,MessageEntityBold,2257.0,275.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,503.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,503.0,,,,,MessageReplies,2.0,25478.0,False,[],,16808.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

U.S. Congress has reviewed a draft law titled ‚ÄúCountering Malign Russian Activities Globally Act‚Äù. Upon reviewing it, U.S. legislators decided to direct the Secretary of State to develop and submit to Congress a strategy and implementation plan outlining United States efforts to counter the malign influence and activities of the Russian Federation and its proxies in Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, and other regions.

While such proceedings usually go below the radar of the general public, this one is quite important because it expands the previous act that covered only Africa and is actually returning the world to the Cold War era. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èThe term of ‚Äúmalign influence‚Äù includes such things as military aid, investments in strategic industries, getting mining concessions and even cooperation in ICT field. The draft law proposes secondary sanctions for governments and government officials in Africa, Latin America, the Middle East and other regions as appropriate, Russian government officials, and other individuals and entities that have facilitated payments and other prohibited activities that benefit United States-sanctioned individuals and entities tied to Russia. 

In simple words, it means that the United States is officially declaring Russia its ‚Äúmalign opponent‚Äù and is about to demand third world countries to choose between supporting Russia or facing U.S. sanctions. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èThis is unprecedented level of pressure even for Cold War times. Anyone dealing with Russia cannot avoid dealing with ‚Äúsanctioned entities‚Äù, which include most top government officials. Technically this law would imply that the U.S. has the right to sanction people like Xi Jinping or Narendra Modi for dealing with Vladimir Putin as well as whole countries. This means that the law will have selective nature and will be used ‚Äúon discretion‚Äù basis, which would open huge opportunities for corruption. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èIf enacted as is, this law can formalize destruction of US-based world order. Third world countries already don‚Äôt like continuous American attempts to impose their rules outside their jurisdiction and this may become the last straw. 

Open ignorance of the law by countries like China, India, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Turkey and other regional powers could give an example to the world and who knows, maybe even weaker states could dare challenge the former hegemon.

‚ñ™Ô∏èBy the way, the Congress has enacted one more resolution that requests U.S. President and directs the  Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State to transmit to the House of Representatives copies of all documents, communications and financial statements detailing purchases, recipients, and government expenditures that relate to congressionally appropriated funds directed to the nation of Ukraine‚Äîwhether in regard to military, civilian, or financial aid‚Äîbetween January 20, 2021 and November 15, 2022. 

Surprise, surprise. It will be very interesting if this investigation won‚Äôt be formal but will be used as a tool to discredit Biden‚Äôs administration and make it a culprit. They definitely won‚Äôt find anything in Ukraine.

As expected, the solution was found and European Commission did appease Hungarian government by unfreezing some of their own funding that was frozen on some rather vague grounds related to alignment of Hungarian anti-corruption laws with EU laws. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èSpeaking about corruption, Eva Kaili was stripped of her position as a vice chairman in the European Parliament because of alleged involvement in bribery related to the choice of Qatar as host of the World Cup. Of course, that‚Äôs not a big deal, EU can continue teach everyone else about what corruption is ü•∏

Anyway, the European Union decided to go on with its mission to support Ukraine. ‚Ç¨18 billion may be a huge sum for one person or even for a large group of people, but it‚Äôs not enough to run a country. Even if Ukraine receives this money, even if it won‚Äôt be stolen by Zelensky and his team, even if it will be used in most efficient way, it will cover just 1/3 of Ukrainian budget deficit in 2023. Not a single cent to restoration, just regular budget expenses. 

United States is also providing financial aid to Ukraine, but it‚Äôs also not unlimited. Again, if the entire $38 billion package proposed by Biden is approved, if Ukraine gets all of it, if not a single cent of it gets stolen, Ukraine has a chance to cover budget deficit in 2023‚Ä¶ unless things get worse, and that‚Äôs what they are going to get if Kiev won‚Äôt get to senses. 

However, it won‚Äôt happen as Biden‚Äôs package is mostly about military aid. U.S. is not interested in getting Ukrainian economy running, it is interested in dealing maximum damage to Russia with the hands of Ukrainians. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èOh, and there is one more interesting thing about this European aid package. This aid package is in fact a 35-year loan that Ukrainians will have to repay, and this is the case with virtually all aid packages to Ukraine. 

It‚Äôs easy to take the money but it‚Äôs hard to return them. Ukrainian national debt has doubled since August. Next year it can quadruple and virtually all remaining state income will go for interest payment. 

Creditors have frozen the debt until December 2023, but they will never write it off. Many future generations of Ukrainians will pay for stupidity and stubbornness of Kiev regime. Dreams of making Russia repay those debts will remain dreams and everyone understands it. 

Zelensky keeps asking for more and more money and weapons but he won‚Äôt get everything he wants. Banks don‚Äôt approve loans to people if their debt burden is too high and they have nothing to offer as a collateral. Dramatic shows may help in fund raising but they don‚Äôt help getting real money.

Last week was marked with escalation of Kosovo crisis in Serbia when police forces of the unrecognized republic have entered Serbian municipalities in violation of previous agreements. Local Serbian population was rightfully worried about that and created barricades to prevent the dangerous outcome.

‚ñ™Ô∏èAfter multiple discussions, official Serbian government decided to use legal methods to come to defense of Kosovo Serbs and appealed to UN resolution as well as Brussels agreements and Washington agreements filing a request to bring joint Serbian police and military forces to Serb-populated areas of the region.

However, the region is occupied by ‚Äúpeacekeeper‚Äù forces of NATO and numerous EU officials have already spoke in support of unrecognized Kosovo, which is about to submit a request for EU candidate status despite not being recognized by five countries of the EU ‚Äî Cyprus, Greece, Romania, Slovakia and Spain. 

This is undoubtedly an artificial crisis that has been created by Kosovo authorities with tacit approval or even upon request of NATO. While formalizing the secession of the criminal-ridden republic from Serbia has always been the ultimate goal of the collective West, this specific moment was chosen for a reason, and the reason is Russia. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èRussian special operation in Ukraine is running well and it does not look like Kiev regime will hold too much longer, especially if it ever gets off western life support. However, at the moment SMO draws a lot of Russian resources and other Russian capabilities are limited. 

If Serbian conflict gets escalated, and it most likely will get escalated as even very moderate Vucic cannot ignore moods in Serbian society and just acknowledge Kosovo and join anti-Russian sanctions, Russian capabilities of helping Serbia directly will be very limited.

If anything happens, Russia won‚Äôt even have an easy way to send any aid to Serbia as the country is landlocked and European air space is closed for Russian aircraft. While this aid can be dispatched through third countries, it‚Äôs still a serious restriction, especially if it is about military aid.

Seeing that Russia has turned the tide in Ukraine and its victory is just a matter of time, whatever it takes, NATO may even resort to military provocations by directly using force against Serbia and maybe exchanging Ukraine for Kosovo. 

If Russia tries sending any serious forces to Serbia, these forces will still be at huge risk and this will reduce Russian capabilities on Ukrainian front. A token force will most likely become a target of provocation, so there are really no good choices here.

However, one thing is important to remember. Russia is not charity. Last time when Russia helped Serbia, it triggered a World War, and this time such possibility is also on the table. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èSerbia is Russia-friendly country, sure, but if they want Russian help, they finally have to choose a side officially. Worth noting that Serbia voted for UN GA resolution that condemned ‚ÄúRussian attack on Ukraine‚Äù. If Serbia was an unquestionable Russian ally, things would be simple. But as it stands, maybe refraining would be a better choice.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1821.0,6.0,2022-12-14T08:19:49+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,45.0,MessageEntityBold,233.0,117.0,MessageEntityBold,666.0,309.0,MessageEntityBold,1320.0,170.0,MessageEntityBold,1597.0,273.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,499.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,499.0,,,,,MessageReplies,12.0,25478.0,False,[],,17719.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On Sunday Ukrainian president Zelensky spoke with U.S. President Joe Biden and reported that about a half of Ukrainian energy grid infrastructure has been destroyed.  

Earlier on Sunday, Ukraine‚Äôs Prime Minister Denys Shmygal said that all thermal and hydroelectric power plants across the country were damaged following ‚Äúeight waves of missile strikes.‚Äù He added that 40 percent of high-voltage power grids ‚Äúwere damaged to varying degrees.‚Äù

‚ñ™Ô∏è Zelensky allegedly asked Biden for more weapons and got his approval, but the reality is looming over him. Latest batches of U.S. aid to Ukraine are now measured in millions, not in billions and Ukrainian masters are reluctant to give away even that in face of expected audits and doubts about any serious perspectives of Ukraine. 

‚ñ™Ô∏è Lack of money is only a half of Ukrainian problem ‚Äî the main problem is that they are not able to restore energy grid as fast as Russian attacks turn it into dust. Moreover, their reserves of spares are depleted and neither Europe nor the U.S. can quickly provide it with equipment based on different standards or even with the necessary amount of generators.

Generators are becoming a next Achilles heel of the Kiev regime. According to estimates, there are about 300,000-400,000 generator sets in Ukraine. Many of them are not intended for continuous long-term operation and in either case, this amount is not even nearly enough to meet energy needs of the country. Latest batch of U.S. aid contained 300 units. Even if every Ukraine‚Äôs ‚Äúsupporter‚Äù will provide the same amount, there still won‚Äôt be enough.  

Generators, fuel, spare parts for power grid, ammunition, weapons, equipment, military hardware, air defense systems. Most of all, money. Ukraine is getting in deeper and deeper dependence on Western supplies, while those supplies are becoming more and more scarce and Ukraine‚Äôs partners are gradually losing their ability to send those supplies.

‚ñ™Ô∏è According to Ukraine, eight waves of missile strikes damaged a half of their energy infrastructure. This means that four-six more waves will completely disable it making life for Russian forces much easier. Even if Kiev regime continues its stubborn resistance with energy grid destroyed, Russia will be free to use its missiles for other critical targets and punch enemy to the state when no resistance will be possible.

As soon as old Ukrainian reserves will be fully depleted, there will be no way for the West to sustain AFU‚Äôs military operations. Immense human casualties don‚Äôt help as well. Foreign mercenaries are not that willing to fight and die for Ukraine while new recruits have really low morale and are mostly used as cannon fodder. 

Remains of professional army and neo-Nazi battalions still manage to hold recruits at the front lines, blocking detachments are still effectively preventing mass desertion and surrender. Ukrainian defense can still look strong from outside.

Bloomberg as well at the whole lot of Western mainstream media reported that it was a sudden decision made as the result of new nuclear threats made by Russian president on December 7th. 

‚ñ™Ô∏è Did Vladimir Putin really come up with nuclear threats or anything that can be interpreted as that? No. He specifically stated that Russian nuclear strategy has defensive purpose and Russian nuclear weapons are going to be used only as response to attacks. 

‚ÄúWe are not crazy, we understand what nuclear weapons are. We have them, and they are more advanced and innovative than those of any other country. It is an obvious fact.‚Äù ‚Äî said Vladimir Putin at the meeting with President‚Äôs Human Rights Council adding that nuclear weapons are ‚Äúnot a factor that provokes escalation but a restrictive factor‚Äù. 

Western campaign of lies continues and they are doing everything in their power to slander Russia and its President presenting them as some maniacs threatening the whole world with nuclear weapons. In last four months Russian President has not voiced any direct threats about potential use of nuclear weapons, he even said that directly as response to numerous false accusations that came in September and October.

‚ñ™Ô∏è Their lies are not sophisticated and can be easily debunked by simply checking on actual transcripts of speeches and interviews of Russian President, Kremlin‚Äôs public relations office and statements of senior officials. All this information is available and moreover, most of it is translated into English, so audience of the global media can easily verify it.

The problem is that a huge part of this audience does not want to verify anything. They just read information and believe it. They are not doing fact-checking, they are not reading debunks, they are not doubting ‚Äúreputable media‚Äù. 

This works not only in the West, but also in the third world, where ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù people are proud of learning to speak English and read English-language news. Many of them are as blind to numerous flaws of the Western media that appeared and grown like a cancer within the course of past two-three decades. 

‚ñ™Ô∏è Of course, Narendra Modi cancelled his meeting with Russian leader for a different reason. They have recently met in person in September, they had a lot of phone calls this year and next year India is hosting G20 summit and Modi has personally invited Vladimir Putin to visit New Delhi. 

Modi does support Russia in its conflict with the West, which is already a big surprise and another achievement of Russian diplomacy. In fact, India is now extending support by supplying Russia with more equipment and raw materials and increasing volumes of oil import from Russia.

Western media deliberately created lies in an attempt to deteriorate relations between Russia and India. Indian media have already publicly debunked this fake story and Russian media space largely ignored that matter altogether.

Of course, exact change of image depends on which part of the world you will ask. Brainwashed Western and non-Western people following global media see Russians as some non-human savages that are coming to destroy civilization. They are mostly people who know little or nothing about Russia and their view is the result of deliberate propaganda campaigns aimed to dehumanize Russian people and present Russia as some kind of alien threat. 

‚ùóÔ∏èThese campaigns started long before the special military operation and in fact date back several centuries. Thanks to Russian unique religious and cultural traditions, its unique set of value, it has been viewed by the Western Europe as some barbaric state ever since Russian liberation from the Mongol yoke.

Those Western people who have critical thinking abilities see Russia as a powerful country that shouldn‚Äôt be messed with. Especially using such shameless ways as closing eyes to Nazification of Ukraine and pushing it to fight. They know history, they know at least something of Russian culture and traditions and they do respect Russia even if they don‚Äôt support it.

As for the rest of the world, they admire Russian bravery, since Russia was brave enough to challenge NATO, and isn‚Äôt going to fall back. Numerous countries humiliated by the United States have dreamed for decades about someone fighting them back. 

Serbia, Iran, Cuba, Venezuela, Syria‚Ä¶ this is just the list of most prominent victims of the U.S. and their military. Virtually all countries of the Third World have suffered from American intervention, be it direct military attack, installation of puppet government, support of rebels, attempts of economic domination ‚Äì U.S. aggression has many forms.

The Western mass media machine is doing everything it can to brainwash people of the West and the rest of the world. It works to an extent, but they cannot hide the fact that 3/4 of the world (by both population and territory) leans to Russia in this conflict. 

And even this media machine is beginning to fail. RT‚Äôs Margarita Simonyan has just shared a story about the Insider* (foreign agent media in Russia) being worried about increased coverage of ‚ÄúRussian propaganda‚Äù stating that 44% of Germans fully or partially agree that ‚ÄúVladimir Putin fights global elites that secretly run the world‚Äù. 

They have to concede that Russian channels are still popular and that their blocks of main Russian media outlets have just resulted in creation of many small Telegram channels and chats that share links to each other and spread the Russian narrative. Even YouTube can‚Äôt continuously track and delete numerous unofficial channels spreading real news from Russia. 

Of course, victory in information war is still a distant prospect. Russia needs more official outlets and channels to reach the global audience. Covering not just the West, but the entire world. RT is a successful case, but Russia needs dozens of such outlets to influence global information space on the same scale the West does.

U.S. Congress has pre-approved defense budget for 2023. It continues increasing for a third year in a row both in sheer numbers and as percent of GDP. Well, inflation doesn‚Äôt go anywhere and US budget is actually their own business. If they feel like spending almost a trillion on support of their bloated network of bases or flawed projects like Zumwalt ‚Äî it‚Äôs their business. 

Worth noting that this November the U.S. Defense Department has failed its fifth-ever audit, unable to account for more than half of its assets, but the effort is being viewed as a ‚Äúteachable moment,‚Äù according to its chief financial officer.

‚ùóÔ∏èAfter 1,600 auditors combed through DOD‚Äôs $3.5 trillion in assets and $3.7 trillion in liabilities, officials found that the department couldn‚Äôt account for about 61 percent of its assets, Pentagon Comptroller Mike McCord.

‚ùóÔ∏è61 percent! While other countries also have their problems, the U.S. scale is just unmatched. Well, world leader, that‚Äôs for sure.

What they found were several new weaknesses in how DOD accounted for its assets, which include nearly 2.9 million military personnel; equipment and weapons including 19,700 aircraft and more than 290 ships; and physical items including buildings, roads and fences on 4,860 sites worldwide.

No audit has ever been even remotely successful and for Americans Pentagon remains a black hole that makes even Ukraine pale in envy. Back in 2017 a Michigan State University economist, working with graduate students and a former government official, found $21 trillion in unauthorized spending in the departments of Defense and Housing and Urban Development for the years 1998-2015.

For comparison, $21 trillion is Ukrainian budget for the period of over 200 years. Small money laundering business in weapons aid is really insignificant compared to those numbers. 

‚ùóÔ∏èBy the way, new budget does not really say much about Ukraine. It allocated about $800 million out of $0.86 trillion to the purpose of military aid to Ukraine, but that‚Äôs it. Of course, the bulk of U.S. weapons and equipment come to Ukraine from stocks of Department of Defense and those stocks are already depleted. A good chunk of the budget goes to arms industry in form of orders to replenish those stocks.

Ukrainians surely have a good reason to worry now. While the U.S. will surely replenish their stocks of missiles, rocket launchers and mobile artillery units, it does not mean that those stocks will be dispatched to Kiev regime. 

Especially now when Russia has finally gained the ability to intercept and destroy HIMARS MLRS and is actively hitting storage facilities with those missiles. Worth noting that one HIMARS missile costs over $150k and Russian strikes destroy them in dozens. 

‚ùóÔ∏èWhy $150k? Of course, production cost is much lower, but military aid to Ukraine is accounted by Pentagon at market prices.

Notwithstanding cold temperatures below -20 ¬∞C, Mongolia is facing quite serious public protests with people accusing the government of corruption in coal trade. Protesters have marched into the center of the capital and are trying to break into administrative buildings including the State Palace.

üü• Officially the reason for unrest was about tens millions tons of coal worth billions of dollars gone missing. Over eighty percent of Mongolian export goes to China and coal constitutes about a quarter of that export, so this is an important part of the state budget.

The corruption story was very real and was in fact uncovered on Chinese end. According to some reports, China has responded to the matter very harshly and the guilty officials were executed, while Mongolia was given the names of its own politicians involved in the criminal scheme. However, government‚Äôs response was very soft and this made Mongolian people unhappy as it looked like the corrupt officials got away with the amount comparable to country‚Äôs annual budget.

üü• Mongolia has already seen public unrest in April when protesters issued demands to fight inflation, eliminate corruption and improve quality of life as Ukrainian crisis resulted in some economical problems for the country. 

For now, Mongolian government has not imposed a state of emergency and it is likely that protests will not expand. While European media outlets are doing their best to fuel them up, they don‚Äôt have the influence and cannot offer protesters any good alternatives. 

üü• Publications such as Bloomberg vouch for privatization of the remaining part of Mongolian coal industry that will allegedly prevent corruption. A large part of Mongolian natural resources is already controlled by foreigners, for example international Rio Tinto group controls the entire copper export of the country. 

While corruption is bad and should definitely punished, conceding natural resources to foreigners doesn‚Äôt mean that Mongolia will get more money. In fact, it will just mean extra profits for international conglomerates that are already enjoying profits from a good part of Mongolian natural riches.

‚¨õÔ∏è For Russia Mongolia remains an important country and a partner as well as a long-term buyer of Russian energy as Russia provides for virtually all energy needs of the steppe country. One more important thing about Mongolia is that it was supposed to become a transit country as one of the branches of Siberian Power 2 pipeline will go to China through Ulan-Bator over almost a 1000 km of Mongolian territory. 

While interference in Mongolia is undesirable for Russia, there is a need to watch for signs of color revolution as both spring protests and current unrest have some indications of foreign support. This is especially noticeable now as the objective of protesters attacks on government buildings is unclear.

As the collective West has successfully hindered export of Russian energy in western direction, the eastern direction becomes more important and Mongolia could become a weak point and the next target for regime change.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1745.0,1.0,2022-12-07T15:32:18+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,23.0,MessageEntityBold,185.0,138.0,MessageEntityBold,325.0,109.0,MessageEntityBold,594.0,76.0,MessageEntityBold,1068.0,225.0,MessageEntityBold,1561.0,142.0,MessageEntityBold,2183.0,181.0,MessageEntityBold,2594.0,196.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,484.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,484.0,,,,,MessageReplies,2.0,25478.0,False,[],,16583.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Myths of immense capacities of U.S. military industrial complex turned out to be somewhat exaggerated. As it turns out, their existing capacities are not sufficient to sustain the Ukrainian army for much longer and they can potentially crank up production to the required level only in 2025.

‚ñ™Ô∏è While in times of World War 2 and even the Cold War U.S. arms industry was working on very different principles. It was a largely state-subsidized industry that was not that much profit-oriented and that used traditional methods prioritizing production capacity. In last decade of the 20th century most of these enterprises switched to ‚Äúefficiency theories‚Äù that were borrowed by the West from Japan, such as Kaizen, Six Sigma, etc. 

Efficient production means that you produce only what you can sell and you cut down costs of maintenance of industrial facilities and equipment that you don‚Äôt need. Cutting down costs and avoiding excessive production is the way to achieve biggest profits. You can produce a bit more counting on future projections, but you will not produce ten times more than you need. 

‚ñ™Ô∏è Besides, in recent decades most orders to American military industrial complex were about the need to support overseas operations of US military and this involved specific orders for many specific types of weapons that were good for expedition forces but are not suitable for a conflict like Ukrainian. 

While U.S. military industrial complex is tightly integrated, it consists of hundreds and thousands of companies and virtually all complex items of weaponry and equipment require cooperation of many entities. It means that when U.S. faced the need to arm Ukraine, it could not just go and start production. 

They needed to place orders, run tenders, select suppliers. Then those suppliers had to return their old manufacturing equipment to service or build new facilities and production lines, find suppliers of components, and so on, and so on. Effectively the U.S. has to create many production facilities from scratch and with unclear prospects of their future use.

‚ñ™Ô∏è Some articles such as HIMARS units and missiles will still be in demand after the Ukrainian conflict ends, but items like Javelins and Stingers are already quite obsolete and it is unlikely that they will be needed anywhere else.

So, while the U.S. military industrial complex enjoys the allocated money and prepares to ramp up production in next couple years, they cannot but think about possible futility of their work if the conflict ends before that.

‚ùóÔ∏èBy the way, those multi-billion numbers of military aid to Ukraine are not so real and not so huge as it seems. The thing is that they are accounting this aid at sale prices. Production costs and sales price are very different. 

US budget pays US military factories and defense contractors their sale price instead of covering their costs of production. Of course, Ukraine will cover the sales price or rather the West will try using frozen Russian assets to cover the sales price if the conflict will end with anything but Russian victory.

What does it all mean for Russia? It‚Äôs not worth underestimating the enemy. However, as U.S. industrial capacity will be fully deployed only around 2024-2025, Russia must use the remaining time window to end the conflict in its favor.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1851.0,1.0,2022-12-06T13:43:34+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,53.0,MessageEntityBold,159.0,190.0,MessageEntityBold,465.0,148.0,MessageEntityBold,688.0,22.0,MessageEntityBold,761.0,17.0,MessageEntityBold,787.0,20.0,MessageEntityBold,1163.0,305.0,MessageEntityBold,1676.0,101.0,MessageEntityBold,2601.0,230.0,MessageEntityBold,3177.0,41.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,482.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,482.0,,,,,MessageReplies,1.0,25478.0,False,[],,16564.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On December 5th Moldovan border guards discovered remains of a missile fallen in Brichansk district of Moldova. Fortunately, the incident did not result in any casualties or any significant damage, the missile just fell into small forest near a settlement. 

Ukrainian media immediately rushed to accuse Russia of launching a missile strike on Moldova territory. However, the Western media have largely ignored this story. Remembering a similar story with ‚ÄúRussian missile strike on Poland‚Äù, they didn‚Äôt rush to accuse Russia and this pause turned out to be the right choice as Ukrainian stories have already been debunked.

‚ñ™Ô∏è The photos clearly show this is a part of S-300 missile, which is used by air defense systems. Maximum theoretical range of S-300 missile complex is 200 kilometers, so it could not have been launched from Russia at any circumstances as the distance from closest Russia-controlled territory to Brichansk district is way over 400 kilometers. 

December 5th was marked by another massive strike of Russian missiles against Ukrainian military facilities and dual-purpose infrastructure. According to Ukrainian reports, most of the missiles have been destroyed by air defense. However, this incident with stray missile obviously shows that Ukrainian air defense does not function properly and that its missiles don‚Äôt fly where intended.

Since Western media did not use this to create another story of ‚ÄúRussian aggression‚Äù and even lies of Ukrainian media looked pretty half-hearted, it looks like this incident was not a provocation but yet another accident of the faulty Ukrainian defense systems of Soviet era.

‚ñ™Ô∏è During years of independence Ukraine did not maintain its S-300 systems well and this specifically applied to missiles. Without proper maintenance and storage missiles become defective and lose some of their aerodynamic properties, which results in reduced chances of hitting the intended target. 

Ukraine had limited stock of missiles for S-300 systems and as misses happen more and more often, it looks like they have used up most of well maintained stock and are now scrapping the reserves. 

‚ñ™Ô∏è This is not the first time when Ukrainian missiles run astray and in fact they are posing a real danger to neighboring countries, especially since Ukraine often tends to accuse Russia of these strikes whether accidental or not. Moreover, they pose danger to Ukrainian cities as well because most of the destruction and damage to civilian structures and buildings in Kiev and other cities are caused not by Russian missile strikes but by misfiring Ukrainian air defense missiles falling down at random.

Fortunately, the threat of Ukrainian air defense is getting lower. The West supplies just a tiny fraction of what Ukraine really needs and as remaining Ukrainian S-300s shoot out their last faulty stocks, they won‚Äôt pose any more threat.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2053.0,5.0,2022-12-06T12:18:54+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,146.0,MessageEntityBold,402.0,262.0,MessageEntityBold,709.0,5.0,MessageEntityBold,791.0,6.0,MessageEntityBold,816.0,14.0,MessageEntityBold,991.0,14.0,MessageEntityBold,1009.0,139.0,MessageEntityBold,1628.0,46.0,MessageEntityBold,1679.0,120.0,MessageEntityBold,2179.0,227.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,481.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,481.0,,,,,MessageReplies,0.0,25478.0,False,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Russian government has already announced that it is not going to deal with any states that will implement the price cap and that response will follow.

‚ÄúThis price cap has three objectives: First, it strengthens the effect of our sanctions. Second, it will further diminish Russia‚Äôs revenues, and thirdly, at the same time, it will stabilize global energy markets,‚Äù said Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission.

üü• Will the price cap achieve those three objectives? 

The first objective is a like dual-edged sword. Yes, the price cap will strengthen the effect of sanctions. It may have some negative effect on Russia, but it will also have equal or greater negative effect on the European Union itself as one of the main consumers of oil in the world. 

The second objective will probably be achieved. Yes, Russia will lose some of its revenues. While Russia will surely sell resources to partners at higher prices, the whole process will be made harder and more expensive. Since these sanctions are also applied to transportation of Russian oil, they will bring up transportation costs and will possibly force Russia to give discounts or sell oil with delivery at port. 

On the other hand, it will stimulate further development of Russian petrochemical industry and refineries. Why sell crude oil if we can sell plastic to our Chinese neighbors who always need it.

The third objective is not from the realm of common sense. If anything, this decision will create turmoil at the global energy market and drive the prices up. Price regulation attempts have never ended well on either side. Russia has the support of OPEC+ and OPEC+ does not like the idea of anyone setting caps that can limit their own revenues.

Price cap on Russian oil can be followed by price cap on Saudi oil ‚Äî they have a history of human rights violation and are involved in Yemen war. It can even be followed by a price cap on Qatar oil ‚Äî the West accuses Qatar of corruption in securing FIFA World Cup and of course in violation of LGBTQ rights.

For now, OPEC decided to keep everything as is. No increase of production to cover potential deficit. This won‚Äôt bring any changes right away, but next year forecasts speak about oil price rising way above $100 even if we don‚Äôt take inflation into account. 

However, OPEC is not on the side of collective West and can yet say their word. In 1970s the world was much less dependent on oil supplies but Arab countries managed to create immense global crisis that caused a decade long period of double-digit USD inflation. This time the situation is very different as there are customers outside the collective West.

üü• Maybe OPEC countries also remember that only two countries did not join the oil embargo in 1970s. Iraq and Lybia. Their fate shows what gratitude of the West is really worth.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1736.0,3.0,2022-12-06T09:33:11+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,83.0,MessageEntityBold,213.0,242.0,MessageEntityBold,521.0,56.0,MessageEntityBold,685.0,180.0,MessageEntityBold,957.0,126.0,MessageEntityBold,1538.0,98.0,MessageEntityBold,1826.0,309.0,MessageEntityBold,2237.0,157.0,MessageEntityBold,2751.0,177.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,480.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,480.0,,,,,MessageReplies,1.0,25478.0,False,[],,16552.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Easy border control, simple migration procedures and prevalence of Russian language played a big role in its popularity among those Russians who decided to relocate for various reasons.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è There are several distinct types of Russian ‚Äúemigrants‚Äù in Kazakhstan.

The first wave came in spring and mainly consisted of two types of people ‚Äî so-called ‚Äúliberals‚Äù who disagreed with special operation of Russian Armed Forces in Ukraine and a number of IT specialists who were working in international projects and had problems with getting payments and being engaged international collaboration due to sanctions.

‚ùóÔ∏èMost ‚Äúliberals‚Äù didn‚Äôt stay in Kazakhstan for long but just used it as a transit point in their journey to ‚Äúcivilized world‚Äù. Locals noticed their arrogance, disregard to local customs and traditions and bloated self-esteem. 

Some IT specialists did stay in Kazakhstan. Many have registered their companies in tax-free zones such as the one in Astana. These companies are often subsidiaries of Russian companies and still have ties with Russia. Many of those specialists have returned to Russia after setting up the infrastructure to circumvent sanctions. 

Some have found jobs in Kazakhstan‚Äôs IT sector although the income level was quite frustrating as compared to Russia. Yet another group of IT specialists, so-called ‚Äúdigital nomads‚Äù working mainly for Western customers, have also moved on to Europe or Asia.

The second wave of migration came in autumn and it contained quite different type of people. If liberals can be considered ‚Äúideological immigrants‚Äù and IT guys are out for the money, September and October were the time of draft dodgers.

Local people have made their distinction and this includes Russians living in Kazakhstan. Nobody is happy about draft dodgers. Many of them are just living on charity and begging for money and shelter at railway stations, few are ready to work for Kazakhstan‚Äôs salary and most of them are planning to return. 

ü™ñ Attitude of Kazakhstan people to SMO is mixed, both among Russians and among Kazakhs. However, all of them share contempt to healthy males running away from their duty, not willing to work and just drinking there time around. 

This influx brought side effects in form of increased costs of living ‚Äî prices for apartment renting have increased by two times or more since the beginning of summer. Students have trouble finding any affordable housing to rent.

It's only a matter of time when draft dodgers will start returning to Russia. While the government probably won‚Äôt implement any repressions against those people, they should not hope that attitude to them at home will be better than in neighboring country.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1931.0,4.0,2022-12-05T14:23:59+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,719.0,MessageEntityBold,991.0,81.0,MessageEntityBold,1398.0,141.0,MessageEntityBold,1721.0,56.0,MessageEntityBold,1867.0,35.0,MessageEntityBold,2319.0,69.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,479.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,479.0,,,,,MessageReplies,4.0,25478.0,False,[],,16560.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That is not so hard to explain. The reason is simple ‚Äî because radical nationalists never came to power in Belarus. Ukrainian example also played a big role, most people in Belarus usually say: ‚ÄúThank you but we don‚Äôt want that experience‚Äù, referring to collapse of Ukrainian economy after 2014 and immense reduction of quality of life.

Besides, Belarus does not have the problem that Ukraine had. For its entire short history Ukraine has been internally split. West Ukraine is ridden with UPA* ideology and mentally closer to countries like Lithuania. It became a part of Ukraine only in times of WW2, just like the Baltic states, and these people probably really felt occupied and oppressed by Soviets. 

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Industrial Donbass has been pro-communist since tsarist times, while agricultural central Ukraine was more reactionary. Split of western Russia** in 1917-1918 between a dozen republics including German protectorate UNR shows the extent of local disagreements. 

Even the story of Bandera‚Äôs* infamous UPA* shows that the great split of Ukrainians continued even under communists. Now it was even more noticeable with UPA* being most popular in the West, while the East and the South giving roots to strong guerilla (‚Äúpartisan‚Äù) movement. 

After WW2 Stalin‚Äôs NKVD was hunting remains of UPA* and Bandera* followers. And again, in the West people weren‚Äôt that eager to give them up while in the East and in the South they were quickly rooted out. 

However, even strongest repressions did not help. In a couple decades Bandera veterans started returning home from labor camps and the ideology began spreading again. West Ukraine was pretty nationalistic and anti-Russian even in late USSR times, while East Ukraine was more pro-Union. 

There has never been such regional split in Belarus. The country is more or less uniform. In Ukraine radical nationalists came to prominence because people were sick of endless row of corrupt leaders. Nationalists didn‚Äôt help the country but at least they offered a culprit - Russia. 

Such thing still can happen in Belarus. Protests against Lukashenko had the scenario similar to Maidan with Western approval of fake president and broad support of social media. However, had they been successful, there would be a chance of radicals (less than 1% of Belarussians) coming to power instead of Lukashenko.

He spoke a lot about future development of Russia and transition to new technological paradigm. 

President rightfully stated that all government institutions, all structures, all public organizations and all citizens must understand that future technological development, technological sovereignty as well as industrial sovereignty and even value sovereignty can be based and can be successful only on the grounds of fundamental and applied science, on the foundation of science. 

Russian President also spoke about the importance of independence and sovereignty of the entire science and industry: ‚ÄúYou can use oil and gas dollars to buy anything: from nails to diamonds. But then you will never produce anything of your own. Therefore, this situation stimulates us to work independently in many areas, including creation of our own instrument base for science‚Äù. 

‚ùóÔ∏èThis can be considered a historical statement as it in fact acknowledged some flaws in former economic policies pursued by Russia and confirmed Russian focus on import substitution. With these words Vladimir Putin put another nail to the coffin of unfair globalization initiatives that manifest in neocolonialism and exploitation of the third world by the collective West. 

‚è± Before 2010s Russia‚Äôs place in globalist world was firmly set by leaders of the New World Order. Russia was supposed to sell its rich natural resources and buy everything it needs from Western exporters. ‚ÄúGlobal gas station‚Äù was a good term for Russia when it largely relied on exports of fossil fuels and abandoned many branches of industry that are now being revived, such as civilian aircraft production. 

In 2010s Russia made first steps to real sovereignty that were boosted by Western sanctions after Russian reunion with Crimea. In some areas such as agriculture

Russia achieved fantastic results, turning from food importer to one of the largest food exporters in the world. Results in other sectors were more modest and while Mishustin‚Äôs government showed great potential, they had to deal with COVID and that slowed down the steamroll of import substitution. 

‚è± In 2022 Russian government proved its competence once again saving the country in spite of unprecedented sanction pressure, withdrawal of Western companies from Russia and disruption of all traditional import and export chains. New sanctions transformed into new opportunities and gave a real boost to even more ambitious and overwhelming import substitution plans. 

As Western countries impose more and more sanctions against Russian oil & gas sector, sales volumes gradually drop. This means that there will be a surplus of fossil fuels on Russian market and the government could use it to give additional boost and extreme competitive advantage to Russian industry and even agriculture. 
Putin‚Äôs words mark the beginning of the new era and considering ambitious plans of reviving Russian industry, it could be better to use this surplus internally instead of shutting down wells or trying to sell it at all costs.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2095.0,1.0,2022-12-02T12:30:20+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,2.0,646.0,MessageEntityBold,766.0,263.0,MessageEntityBold,1216.0,194.0,MessageEntityBold,1616.0,20.0,MessageEntityBold,1823.0,161.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,474.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,474.0,,,,,MessageReplies,5.0,25478.0,False,[],,16453.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This initiative serves two objectives. 

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Firstly, this is yet another step of methodical process of framing and villainizing Russia and Russian people. It will use all fakes, unverified rumors and claims of Kiev regime as ‚Äúfactual evidence‚Äù and will likely blame Russia of all imaginable and unimaginable sins. Maybe they will even declare Russia innocent of some minor violations or debunk some fakes to gain credibility. 

This objective is important for European Council to keep brainwashing people of Europe and legitimize their own crimes against Russia (on that later). They need to explain Europeans that only Ukraine protects them from ‚ÄúRussian hordes‚Äù and they will create a vivid picture that will scare the hell out of common EU citizens making them happy to tolerate some ‚Äúinconvenience‚Äù and forget economic crisis to fight the ‚Äúuniversal evil‚Äù. 

‚ñ∂Ô∏è The second objective is much more trivial. Europe still pretends to live by the rule of law and is still looking for pretext to confiscate frozen Russian assets stored in its jurisdiction. The process has already started with recent proposal of EU President von der Leyen to create ‚Äúa structure to manage these funds and invest them‚Äù. 

‚ùóÔ∏èStarting from the beginning of the special operation, Western countries have blocked about $300 billion reserves of Russian Central Bank and about $20 billion in assets owned by private individuals. Freezing itself is a gross violation of all international laws and treaties and greatly undermined trust of the entire world in the collective West. However, confiscation would constitute even a greater transgression.

Therefore, Europe and the collective West needs some means to legitimize seizure or, plainly speaking, theft of Russian assets and the proposed ‚Äútribunal‚Äù is going to serve exactly that purpose. They will establish arbitrary assessment of damage and voila, Ukraine will get the money. 

But that‚Äôs just what Ukraine thinks. As we have numerously noted, European Union is undergoing deep economic crisis and there are strong signs of its coming deindustrialization with European companies moving production to China and even the United States. So, this money is more likely to cover a big hole in EU pockets that appeared due to ‚Äúaid to Ukraine‚Äù, which of course was not ‚Äúfree‚Äù. Naturally, Zelensky and his team will get their cut to enjoy retirement in some sunny place 

All this is nice, but they forgot one thing ‚Äî time for tribunals comes after victory. Russia does not acknowledge this tribunal, so instead of legitimizing EU actions it will delegitimize them and undermine global trust in the collective West even further. 

It‚Äôs a bit strange that this gesture came from France, which was one of the least Russophobe countries on the European continent and has its own opinion about Ukrainian conflict. President Macron reverberates the narrative of the collective West but he also has to listen to his people and it‚Äôs not an accident that many French companies are still operating in Russia.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2177.0,5.0,2022-12-02T11:09:04+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,2.0,254.0,MessageEntityBold,268.0,100.0,MessageEntityBold,440.0,18.0,MessageEntityUnderline,777.0,15.0,MessageEntityBold,861.0,17.0,MessageEntityBold,1002.0,15.0,MessageEntityBold,1058.0,16.0,MessageEntityBold,1124.0,144.0,MessageEntityBold,1363.0,51.0,MessageEntityBold,1510.0,13.0,MessageEntityBold,1566.0,12.0,MessageEntityBold,1768.0,70.0,MessageEntityBold,2610.0,259.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,473.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,473.0,,,,,MessageReplies,7.0,25478.0,False,[],,16515.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The collective West actively condemns Russia for attacks on dual-purpose infrastructure and ignores the fact that all those attacks can be easily stopped by Ukrainian side accepting Russian terms. 

It looks like they have forgotten not so distant past when NATO itself was waging a war in Europe using this kind of tactics from the very beginning. Here is an excerpt from the transcript of NATO Press Conference dated May 25, 1999.

‚Ä¢ Norwegian News Agency: I am sorry Jamie but if you say that the Army has a lot of back-up generators, why are you depriving 70% of the country of not only electricity, but also water supply, if he has so much back-up electricity that he can use because you say you are only targeting military targets?

‚Ä¢ Jamie Shea, NATO spokesman: Yes, I'm afraid electricity also drives command and control systems. If President Milosevic really wants all of his population to have water and electricity all he has to do is accept NATO's five conditions and we will stop this campaign. But as long as he doesn't do so we will continue to attack those targets which provide the electricity for his armed forces. If that has civilian consequences, it's for him to deal with but that water, that electricity is turned back on for the people of Serbia. Unfortunately, it has been turned off for good or at least for a long, long time for all of those 1.6 million Kosovar Albanians who have been driven from their homes and who have suffered, not inconvenience, but suffered in many cases permanent damage to their lives. Now that may not be a distinction that everybody likes but for me that distinction is fundamental.

‚è± In 1999, NATO was doing exactly the same thing that Russia is doing and they were doing it from the very beginning of that campaign. At least, back then they were a bit less hypocritical and openly spoke of their objectives and things they were doing. Now they would probably say that it‚Äôs Milosevic shelling his own energy infrastructure.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è So what changes, if we replace Serbia with Ukraine and Milosevic with Zelensky? The reasoning is the same and the Kosovo precedent is sufficient to refute any accusations that NATO hypocrites are spitting at Russia. 

When Kiev regime was cutting off electricity to Crimea, when they stopped water supply to the peninsula, when they were continuously shelling Donbass destroying a large part of its infrastructure, did they care about millions of people living there? 

Using their own words, people of Donbass and Crimea have suffered in many cases permanent damage to their lives, millions of people had to escape from Donbass to Russia just to survive.

Meanwhile more and more challenges are looming for the U.S. on the horizon with the main challenge being the People‚Äôs Republic of China. 

Media of the collective West have broadly covered recent unrest in China aimed to cancel lockdowns and zero COVID tolerance policies. Moreover, BBC has been directly involved in the protests with its journalists directly participating in them and arrested by the police. 

‚ùóÔ∏èAccording to official Chinese position, these protests were staged by external forces as the police found methodical guidelines written in Traditional Chinese, which is mainly used in Hongkong and Taiwan, while mainland China used simplified Chinese. 

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Despite broad coverage of minor protests that greatly resembled some of unsanctioned protests in Russia, Western media conveniently ignored a much more important event for China ‚Äî Taiwan elections that resulted in separatists losing power. This outcome effectively breaks the U.S. strategy to alienate Taiwan from China and keep using the island as one of its main bases in Asia Pacific region. 

There are some indications that with failure to undermine Chinese government on the mainland some forces in the United States consider starting a color revolution in Taiwan in the last attempt to stop transformation of China to global superpower number one.

‚ùóÔ∏èIndeed, China has already become top economy of the world and with its gradual drift to Russia it is bound to become the most dangerous challenger that the U.S. have ever faced. As for Chinese Armed Forces, they are already getting on par with USAF and even their nuclear arsenal is allegedly set to increase to at least 1500 warheads, according to recent Pentagon report. 

Events like todays joint patrol mission of Russian and Chinese strategic bombers show that relations between Russia and China are as cordial as ever and even imply existence of an informal military alliance between the two great powers. 

‚ñ∂Ô∏è According to the above quoted report, China is likely to create PLA logistics facilities if not full-scale bases at such countries as Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, UAE, Kenya, Seychelles, Equatorial Guinea, Tanzania, Angola, Tajikistan, Namibia, Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands. Of course, this is not yet a match for U.S. global network of military bases but a very solid breakthrough for China that will start with the first small step ‚Äî Ream Naval Base in Cambodia

Naturally, the U.S. needs both financial resources and physical arms to continue its policy of China containment and Ukrainian conflict consumes too much of those. U.S. elites know and understand that very well.

ü§î This statement makes perfect sense as Poland is one of the most involved countries in the Ukrainian conflicts. According to intelligence, Polish mercenaries are present in AFU in large numbers, and this is confirmed by reports from the battlefields on large casualties among them. 

Ukraine has already granted Poland preferred status by enacting law ""On legal and social guarantees for citizens of the Republic of Poland located at the territory of Ukraine‚Äù that effectively grants Poles all rights and freedoms as if they were citizens of Ukraine.

‚è± Galicia-Volynhia has been a part of Polish state for many centuries ever since it was occupied after withdrawal of Mongols from the area. After dissolution of Polish state in the 18th century this area went to control of Austro-Hungarian Empire and returned to Poland after the end of WW1. USSR took lands of Western Ukraine from Poland at the times of World War 2 and after the war Poland was granted a large chunk of East Prussia from Germany as compensation for keeping them as a part of Ukrainian SSR. 

Naturally, Poland has not yet forgotten and abandoned their claims and have considered their return ever since the beginning of Ukrainian conflict. As Ukrainian war effort is dwindling and the country is getting closer to collapse day after day, Polish government seems to consider their options. 

Polish society is somewhat split on the issue and in fact this expansion is not supported by majority. Economic situation in the country is getting dire with growing prices and millions of Poles finding themselves below the poverty line. The experience of contact with refugees from Ukraine is also not making Poles eager to add new territories with new citizens. Besides, they are definitely not fond of Bandera ideology.

However, the window of opportunity may close pretty soon. 2023 elections will likely see the currently ruling party ‚ÄúRight and justice‚Äù of famous Russophobe Jaroslaw Kachinsky losing power to ‚ÄúCivil coalition‚Äù of Donald Tusk. Only some great achievement such as expansion of Poland can make Poles forget about reduced quality of life and grim prospects on the future resulting from Polish pledge to support Kiev regime. 

‚ùóÔ∏èMoreover, since the survival of Ukrainian state depends solely on continuous flows of money and weapons coming from the U.S. and to lesser extent Europe, abrupt termination or even reduction of these flows may cause untimely collapse of Ukrainian state before Poland gets a chance to press its claims. 

ü§î Will West Ukrainians agree with that? No doubt, especially this will mean automatic EU citizenship for them. It looks like Kiev regime is also considering this option a viable opportunity. It‚Äôs worth noting that latest waves of full mobilization target only East and South regions of the country with prevalent Russian-speaking population, while West Ukrainians are spared.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,3026.0,13.0,2022-12-01T08:21:34+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,118.0,105.0,MessageEntityBold,580.0,107.0,MessageEntityBold,1301.0,135.0,MessageEntityBold,1692.0,133.0,MessageEntityBold,2129.0,19.0,MessageEntityBold,2205.0,17.0,MessageEntityBold,2435.0,346.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,470.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,470.0,,,,,MessageReplies,4.0,25478.0,False,[],,16414.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

‚ûñThis is a question that worries many people throughout the world watching proxy war between the Russia and the West that currently takes form of Ukrainian conflict. Some of them cheer for Ukraine, some cheer for Russia, most just want to see de-escalation and end of the conflict. 

‚ûñDespite Russian openness to possible diplomatic solution, unrealistic terms of Kiev regime make any form of negotiations impossible. Therefore, the conflict is bound to last until one of the sides surrenders or changes its position. 

‚ûñRussian Federation has obvious advantage in this conflict, while Ukraine would already lose its ability to supply the army if not for military and financial aid from the Western countries. However, even despite this aid, Ukraine is barely holding and as U.S. and European ‚Äúhelpers‚Äù are becoming less and less eager to keep feeding Ukrainian ‚Äúblack hole‚Äù with money and arms, the situation slowly and steadily advances to Russian victory.

‚ûñEconomy of Ukraine is ruined, it lost the ability to service its debt back in August. More than a half of its expenses are currently covered by the West, but this aid does not come for free and when creditors will unfreeze the debts Ukraine will be done no matter what is left of it. 
Energy grid of Ukraine is close to total collapse. Kiev chose military over civilians and cities have electrical power for just a couple hours a day with heating and water supply systems also close to failure in this mode. Food crisis is also looming on the horizon and full-scale humanitarian disaster is a matter of a couple months if not weeks
Supply routes from EU have been seemingly intact for a long time, however there are first signs of their collapse as well ‚Äî this weekend Krivoy Rog railways ceased operation for indefinite period of time. Ukrainian forces use a lot of ammunition and are unlikely to hold for long without steady and continuous supplies. Railroad failure also creates big problems for movement of troops, so destruction of supply routes is likely to result in collapse of the front.

‚ûñUkrainian air defense system is in shambles, half of its S-300 are disabled and the rest are already short on missiles while a few West-supplied batteries do not pose any serious threat. Since neither Ukraine nor the West can produce or maintain S-300 missiles, Ukrainian air defense may crumble any moment, possibly after a few more incidents such as recent fall of missiles to Poland. 

‚ûñWith air defenses down Russian Air Force will gain air domination in Ukrainian skies and this will also be the end of the story.

Predicted shortfalls of U.S. and NATO industry to ramp up production are coming closer and closer and the breakpoint is expected to happen no later than spring. That is, if Ukraine will keep using up ammunition at current rate and if the West will not supply more modern systems. 

‚ûñIt has been stated that the reason for unreadiness of the West is the need to adapt of U.S. and European arms industry for new types of production. Ever since the end of the Cold War NATO has used their military mostly to invade remote countries and therefore arms production was shifted to suit the needs of this kind of warfare.
Most NATO countries have already depleted their stores and are no longer able to help Ukraine with anything, especially with ammunition that is used by Ukraine at the rate unseen since World War 2. Even the U.S., the country with the strongest arms industry in NATO, needs a month to produce the amount of ammunition that Ukraine uses in 2-3 days. 

‚ûñIn face of imminent shortages the U.S.-led NATO is already resorting to alternative options such as supply of older TOW ammunition instead of Javelins, procurement of artillery shells in South Korea and ramping up production of old Soviet-standard weapons at Eastern European plants.
Ukraine‚Äôs own arms industry is close to non-existent and without Western supplies it would simply run out of everything months ago. While alternative options will give Ukraine a chance to last until spring, in some areas its situation is even more dire. 
The most critical of those areas is air defense. Ukraine has about a half of its S-300 batteries left and is already experiencing severe shortage of missiles for those batteries. Neither Ukraine nor any of its partners are able to produce or even maintain missiles for the most famous air defense system of Soviet-era.

‚ûñSupplied small batches of Western air defense systems do not help, Ukraine barely has enough of them to defend one large city and once its S-300 network fails, few NATO-standard batteries won‚Äôt pose serious threat for Russian aviation. Even if NATO countries fulfill all their promises, they are about to supply no more than 20 batteries next year, which is absolutely not enough. The only option is to sacrifice their own systems and go defenseless, but even the most Russophobe countries aren‚Äôt very eager to take this risks.
That said, it is likely that even if Ukraine does not surrender because of blackouts and inability to supply the army, there will be a period when Russian Armed Forces will get the decisive advantage in form of AFU‚Äôs dire deficit of ammunition.

""We are ready to endure this,"" Olena Zelenska asserted when talking to BBC journalists in a heavily secured compound tucked inside a sandbagged labyrinth of buildings in Kyiv.  ""We've had so many terrible challenges, seen so many victims, so much destruction, that blackouts are not the worst thing to happen to us.""

‚ûñShe also cites a recent poll where 90 % of Ukrainians said they were ready to live with electricity shortages for two to three years if they could see the prospect of joining the European Union. 

‚ûñWhile this all could sound good for the Western audience, the reality is quite pathetic. This lady hides in safe bunkers and residences with no shortage of anything and reverberates her husband‚Äôs chants about Ukrainian willingness to keep fighting and dying.

‚ûñIt doesn‚Äôt look like this poll was taken among those people in Kiev, Kharkiv or Odessa who are finally facing the beginning of long cold winter without any positive outlook for the future. Ukrainians are known to easily fall for beautiful life promises, but this looks too much even for them. Especially as European Union officials have clearly stated many times that Ukrainian membership is not on the table in any foreseeable future. They got their visa-free access, EU does need cheap labor force, but that‚Äôs it. 

‚ûñDespite playing hunted victims on par with her husband, neither Olena Zelenska nor her husband have been targeted by Russia personally. Russia had numerous opportunities to liquidate them both, but it would not bring anything. They are not decision-makers, they are a show crew. Time to pay will come later when this nice lady will have to explain her calls to U.S. Congress for weapon supplies or numerous demands to NATO to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine. 

‚ûñThe pretty lady has already shown her teeth in her autumn address to European people where she blamed them for counting money ‚Äúwhile we are dying here‚Äù. She looks pretty well for a dying person and as for money, there are a couple questions. First, how many more billions will make her happy? Second, why do European and American people have to pay for stubbornness of her husband and why does she take it for granted?

‚ûñWe could also ask where the money goes, as the Ukraine has received almost double its pre-war yearly budget and it was not just military aid, but this question doesn‚Äôt even need answering. One thing is for sure ‚Äî suffering and sacrifices are reserved for common Ukrainian people while the elites keep enjoying their luxury.

‚ûñAnyway, she was absolutely right in one thing ‚Äî this is a war of world views and there can be no peace without victory.

‚ûñSoon after the beginning of the special military operation many eastern European militaries and manufacturers began emptying their warehouses of Soviet-era weapons and ammunition that Ukrainians were familiar with, as Kiev waited for NATO-standard equipment from the West.

‚ûñAs those stocks have dwindled, arms makers have boosted production of both older and modern equipment to keep supplies flowing. The ongoing stream of weapons has helped Ukraine to sustain its army and prevented its early collapse.

‚òùÔ∏èNaturally, this means money. There is a good reason why Russophobe governments of Eastern Europe are so eager in extending this war for as long as possible and keep endorsing Ukrainian regime to continue its hopeless resistance. 

‚ûñTransition to NATO standards of weaponry in Ukraine created a lot of problems and short training does provide necessary skills to operate this weaponry. Therefore, many such systems are operated by foreign mercenaries or under direct control of foreign military advisors. Still, Ukrainians make a lot of blunders with use of Western weapons. Recent report of NASAMS missile hitting a residential building in Kiev is just a tip of an iceberg.

‚ûñCountries like Czechia have long history as arms producers. Back in time of World War II Czech plants were working three shifts to supply the Third Reich with weapons until the very last moment. In times of Warsaw Pact Eastern European arms industry also thrived and produced a lot of military supplies and equipment under Soviet standards. 

‚ûñThey use this experience now to supply Kiev regime with ammunition and weapons that AFU is familiar with and these supplies pose a greater threat for the SMO than all military aid by the West that is not compatible with Ukrainian system and that cannot be effectively used without Western instructors. 

‚ûñSoviet-standard weapons are simple, cheap and reliable and as Ukraine and its backers have depleted most its own Soviet-era arsenals, continued flow of weapons from former communist states of Eastern Europe is becoming more and more critical for survival of Kiev regime.
Therefore, one of the primary short-term objectives of the special military operation should be disruption of this seemingly endless flow of supplies. NATO standard weapons are misused and often end up on black market, but Soviet-standard weapons are the base of continued resistance.

Russian Vice Prime Minister Novak has already declared that Russia is not going to give in and acknowledge any price caps and that Russia will cease supplies to any countries that will implement these restrictions and will either redirect supplies to market-oriented countries or reduce its oil production.

üìû Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday in a phone call with Prime Minister of Iraq that all Western attempts to impose price caps on Russian oil will lead to heavy consequences for the entire world. Kremlin website says:

 ‚ÄúDiscussion also covered situation with attempts of a number of Western countries to impose restrictions on prices of oil materials supplied by Russia. Vladimir Putin stressed that such actions contradict the principles of free market and will highly likely result in heavy consequences for the global energy market.‚Äù

‚ûñThe impact of potential price caps on oil and gas market depends on actual price caps that will be established. While highest proposed range is way above current market prices and is unlikely to impact any supplies, the lowest range that is championed by some of the most Russophobe countries will inevitably result in global shortage of fossil fuels and will push prices up. 

‚ûñWhile this discussion has little practical relevance to the U.S., European countries are literally deciding their own fate. Shall they implement those price caps, they will deprive themselves of all chances to revive European industry. Indeed, the situation with industrial production in Europe is becoming more and more dire, existing projects are suspended and stalled while new projects look for sites in Asia where production costs are going to be much lower. 

‚ûñLeading EU countries keep subsidizing their industry and economy but they cannot do it forever as their wealth and credit indeed depend on their industrial might. However, they have little options because of the need to subsidize many other things and primarily the consumer and utilities sectors to get Europeans through the winter.

‚ûñ This is yet another unprecedented and completely unsubstantiated statement that is probably backed by own ideas of those officials about what they would do in similar situation. However, simply dismissing it is not a very good idea.

‚ûñThis practice of ‚Äúinformation injection‚Äù was commonly used to prepare Western public opinion to similar accusations against leaders of other countries such as Iraq, Syria and Lybia. We have already seen how single unverified media publications eventually culminated in invasion and destruction of whole countries. 

‚ùóÔ∏è The whole world remembers the story with a vial of detergent that ultimately resulted in destruction of all Iraq cities and infrastructure, murder of its president and the rise of one of the most notorious terrorist organizations. That story also started with media reports and anonymous sources.

‚òùÔ∏è So, if this publication is followed by more such works, it is worth considering it a ‚Äúred flag‚Äù, a sign that some kind of provocation involving chemical weapons is being prepared in Ukraine. Ukraine‚Äôs regime and Western warmongers supporting it are desperately looking for excuses to trigger direct intervention of NATO in the conflict, as it is the only way to prevent Ukraine‚Äôs collapse and capitulation. 

‚ûñThe ‚Äúdirty bomb‚Äù story has been exposed by Russia and lost its potential impact, although it‚Äôs still to early to completely dismiss the probability of such provocation. The ‚Äúmissiles in Poland‚Äù story was way too crude and was probably the initiative of Ukrainian authorities and not their Western sponsors.

‚ûñHowever, the ‚Äúchemical weapon‚Äù story perfectly fits in typical modus operandi of the collective West. Ukraine has enough experienced actors that have been seen in numerous videos of ‚ÄúRussian atrocities‚Äù, so they could easily stage a ‚Äúchemical attack‚Äù of any scale. Moreover, Kiev regime is not known for having mercy or caring at least a little bit about its citizens, so they could really use it against their own troops, especially on forces with questionable loyalty. 
The best course of action for Russia would be to bring up global attention to these rumors. It worked with the dirty bomb, especially when Russia provided details of the planned provocation. However, even if Russian intelligence doesn‚Äôt get any confirmation or specific information about ‚Äúchemical provocation‚Äù, it‚Äôs still worth being on high alert about such things.

‚òùÔ∏è This is another example of Ukrainian ignorance of all basic human rights with regard to any people that do not blindly support the regime and dare to have their own opinion on any issues from culture and literature to religion.

‚òùÔ∏è People may have different attitude to religion but even atheists don‚Äôt deny that any person has the right to decide what to believe in and that any religion and any church has the right to exist as long as it does not directly call its members to break civilian laws. This is not the case with Russian Orthodox Church that has not been calling its Ukrainian congregation to anything illegal except for praying for peace.

‚ûñ Servants of Ukrainian regime have desecrated a holy place for the sake of destroying the last vestiges of cultural ties between Russia and Ukraine in form of shared Orthodox religion. The split in Orthodox church is a church business, not the business of secular authorities and hostile actions against a Church are crossing all possible lines. 

‚ûñ Of course, Western supporters of Ukrainian freedom don‚Äôt really care if Ukraine violates base principles of the freedom of faith. In fact, they would be glad to see this conflict to turn into a war of religion especially when its target is Russian Orthodox Church.

‚ûñ Naturally, they would prefer Christian churches where people freely interpret words of holy scriptures and proclaim themselves prophets, where all Christian values are adapted to ‚Äúmodern realities‚Äù. Even atheists consider these attempts to adapt Christian faith to ultraliberal values disgusting. Virtues and sins form the core of religious values and Western Christianity is gradually driven away from those values. It would be fine, nobody should be force to share a religion, but as they say, ‚Äúeither take off your cross or put on your underpants‚Äù.

‚ûñWith Constantinople patriarch becoming a puppet of the collective West and conceding to ‚Äúnew order‚Äù by endorsing sin and giving communion to unrepented sinners, with the Pope endorsing same-sex marriages Russian Orthodox Church is really becoming the last bastion of traditional Christianity.

These stations are intended to provide base services to population in case of long-term disruptions of electricity supplies that are expected to happen in nearest future, according to Ukrainian national energy company.

‚ûñThis announcement actually looks like another PR move in an attempt to mitigate global discontent against Zelensky‚Äôs regime. His cronies can‚Äôt really think that a few stations in cities (with a large part of them in the capital) will indeed help in case of a catastrophic outcome while the regime keeps clinging to its war effort. 

‚ûñUkrainian people are definitely not happy to see the energy crisis hitting and consider this announcement yet another humiliation. In other circumstances they would certainly rebel against such a government, but now they see that any such attempt would be crushed with brutal force especially as virtually all healthy males have been taken by the Ukrainian war machine. 

‚òùÔ∏èMany regions of Ukraine are slowly boiling. The government openly recommends people to leave Ukraine to survive the winter. Those who won‚Äôt leave are supposed to do on their own with ‚Äúinvincibility stations‚Äù where they can charge their phones to read about ‚Äúgreat successes of Ukrainian army‚Äù.

‚ùìWhat about the army itself? While it is still being supplied, everything is not so simple. Russian strikes have seriously disrupted Ukrainian supply capabilities and maintaining almost a million-sized army is way above the capacity of Ukraine even with the aid of the collective West because Ukraine has a physical deficit of too many resources to go on. The West does provide money to Kiev regime but money is of no use if there is nothing to buy. 

‚ùóÔ∏èNext logical targets of the Russian Armed Forces would be Ukrainian railway system in the West of the country that is a backbone of supplies from Europe, as well as the main road network, which has already limited throughput. 

‚ûñIt looks like Russia hesitates to cut these supplies because it will result in even greater pressure on civilian population and it is very unlikely that Zelensky‚Äôs regime will allocate resources to civilians instead of the military. Especially since there is a non-zero risk that without proper supplies military forces will get out of control and resort to marauding or maybe will even turn on Kiev itself. It is unlikely while retreat-blocking detachments, nationalist formations and mercenaries still have their grip on the army, but this may change as supplies dwindle.

‚ûñMany Ukrainians are already thinking whether it is worth to keep suffering to keep Zelensky‚Äôs show running.

After Ukrainian strike on the power plant with a heavy artillery this weekend, IAEA stuck to its previous stance stating that it cannot confirm that the attack came from any parties of the conflict.

‚ûñIAEA has confirmed serious wreckage of power plant facilities including damage of condensate storage tanks resulting in leakage of non-radioactive materials and very heavy damage to access routes. At the same time they noted that six reactor units are in stable state and storage facilities for radioactive waste remain intact.
Zelensky regime keeps pushing the narrative about Russia shelling its own forces defending the power plant and demanding UN to establish a demilitarized zone around the plant. While the reactors are already shut down and the level of risk to them is low, Russia is worried about hazard posed by potential hits to radioactive waste. 

‚ùóÔ∏èRussian nuclear energy experts have proposed evacuation of all hazardous components and materials to Russia. This proposal is indeed feasible as it will reduce the risks of nuclear incidents and will probably stop Ukrainian shelling aimed to cause such incident and put the blame on Russia.

‚òùÔ∏èThere also are indications that Zaporozhye nuclear plant is not the only potential target of Ukrainian provocations. On Tuesday British newspaper headline was saying that ‚ÄúRussia is planning false flag terror attack on Belarus nuclear power plant which it would blame on NATO or Ukraine‚Äù. 

‚ûñWe know that Russian attack on Belarus is absolutely out of question. We know that nuclear incident at BelAES, which was named as ‚Äúpotential target‚Äù, can cause huge damage to lands of Belarus and Russia and possibly Poland and Lithuania. 

‚ûñWe know that the United Kingdom has been continuously propping up Ukrainian war effort and provided full media support to Kiev regime. We know that when Ukraine starts speaking of ‚Äúfalse flags‚Äù, it means that they are planning a provocation, another nasty trick that will keep them in center of attention despite widespread Ukraine fatigue in the collective West. 

‚ûñBritish articles cites intelligence agency of Ukrainian ministry of defense as its source, so it is definitely worth to increase security level on Belarussian power plant and make sure that it is well defended against potential air strikes and terrorist attacks.

‚ûñIt is astonishing how can the Western public be so gullible to believe in such blatant lies and not to demand their governments to stop supporting criminal regime that openly blackmails Europe with nuclear catastrophe.

Starting from October 10th, Russian Armed Forces are launching almost daily strikes over power grid infrastructure, defense industry facilities, military command facilities and communication infrastructure over the entire Ukraine. 

‚ûñUkraine national energy company warns all regions about unplanned energy outages in addition to planned shutdowns. Many regions have no power available for more than half of the day. Additional Russian strikes on gas infrastructure and fuel storage facilities make use of portable generators problematic in the environment of fuel deficit. 

‚ùóÔ∏èFuel prices have almost doubled since February. Panic buying, limited supplies and army needs push prices up every day. It is already likely that a fuel crisis will follow soon as Ukrainian refineries have been in poor shape even before 2022 and some of them have been seriously damaged by missile strikes. It‚Äôs a matter of short time when Kiev government will have to choose between military and civilian supplies.

‚ûñWith energy collapse of Ukraine becoming imminent, some regions receive better treatment than the others. People of Odessa have already noted that Ukrainian energy authorities favor western Ukrainian cities such as Lviv at the cost of Odessa, Nikolaev and other Russian-speaking cities. As Ukrainian power grid has ring-based structure, this is theoretically possible. 

‚ûñSuch discrimination creates further tensions between regions and makes people really discontent with Zelensky‚Äôs regime. Such moods are especially noticeable in eastern and southern regions of Ukraine that traditionally had Russian-speaking population. While most Russian-speaking people there are still angry with Russia, they are equally unhappy with Kiev regime and their support for its war effort is gradually dwindling.

‚ûñIndiscriminate mobilization, deprivations, belligerent statements of Zelensky‚Äôs henchmen as well as preferential treatment for Kiev and western regions make Russian-speaking regions of Ukraine wonder and worry about intentions of the regime.
Despite the lack of verified information and total suppression of all opposition in Ukraine, online activity of Russian-speaking community shows continuously increasing unhappiness. Life is getting too hard and people finally started blaming Kiev for its stubborn and stupid policy of no negotiation.

‚ùå EU and G7 are about to implement a new package of sanctions against Russia that will involve oil price cap. It is expected that actual price corridor will be announced this week. Russia has already announced that it is not going to acknowledge any price caps and will sell its oil at its own prices as before. 

‚ùóÔ∏èThe cap seeks to bar shipping companies and insurers from transporting Russian oil unless it is sold below the agreed price cap, and all 27 EU countries need to agree to it for it to enter into force. Diplomats warned they were unsure whether Greece, Cyprus or Malta would have any last-minute concerns as it will obviously hurt their shipping industries. 

‚òùÔ∏èHowever, officials said the EU had already made concessions to the three countries and weakened sanctions on other Russian goods such as fertilizers, cement and other products to soften the blow for their shipping industries. Nonetheless, they are already losing parts of their tanker fleets, which reportedly are already ditching EU flags in favor of those of China, Turkey, India or of various tax havens to avoid the EU and U.S.-imposed price cap.

‚ùìWill it create difficulties for Russia? Maybe there will be some short-term problems, but as a general rule, the longer those US/EU sanctions against Russia will last and the more comprehensive they will be, the more Russia will diversify its economy and trade partners to sustain them until making them irrelevant.

‚ûñAs shown by numerous examples, sanctions never yield the intended results or result in any concessions. In fact, sanctions impose two-way restrictions and cripple all markets they concern, especially in case with such a large exporter as Russia.

‚ûñRussia is not the main victim of Western sanctions against it. The main victims are poor countries of the world that relied on lower prices and are falling deeper into debt unable to sustain their economy in the new reality and unable to challenge the Western World Order.

The most important thing is that Russia doesn‚Äôt have the problem of rising costs. The very idea of sanctions was based on assumption that Russian economy largely depends on import from the West and will fail to meet demand if the West cuts the ties. 

‚ûñHowever, this wasn‚Äôt the case as someone forgot to account for one important thing. When a British company owns a factory in Russia, it‚Äôs not a British factory. When this British company decided to withdraw from Russia, it couldn‚Äôt take the factory with it and so it sold it to its Russian management or partners. The factory is still here, in Russia, and it still produces the same things it produced before.

‚òùÔ∏èAfter 2014 events in Ukraine and first sanctions from the West Russia started the course of import substitution. Of course, it hasn‚Äôt been successful in all fields and many things could have been done better. Nonetheless, these initiatives ensured Russian food safety and turned Russia from net importer of food to net exporter. Not so long ago Russia was buying grain, meat and poultry abroad and now it is one of the largest global exporters.

‚ûñFood inflation is the most important part of overall inflation as it directly impacts the essentials ‚Äî nobody can live without food. Since Russia produces all basic food and does not import it, there is no risk of deficit and no risk of further inflation spikes above the targets established by the government.

‚ûñMishustin‚Äôs government is doing a great job running the economy and stimulating import substitution initiatives to make up for some slowdown in previous years. Inflation has been covered by increase of average income level in the country and especially by noticeable increase of pensions for the most socially vulnerable categories.

A 25-year-old resident of Hualien City has served in the Taiwan Army since March. In his Facebook account, he stated that he is still an active member of the Taiwanese army. 

Yuhun went to Ukraine in March, having signed a contract with the battalion ""Carpathian Sich"".

He also stated that he is ready for negotiations with Russia but wants to make these negotiations public.   üî∑Kremlin‚Äôs spokesman Dmitry Peskov responded to this statement: ‚ÄúThere is no such thing as public negotiations. Especially this kind of negotiations. One thing is absolutely clear: Ukrainian side does not want any negotiations, special military operation continues and its objectives must be fulfilled‚Äù.

‚ùìWhat do those offers by Zelensky signal? First he enacts a law prohibiting all negotiations with Russia, then he talks about prisoner exchanges and some commercial deals, then offers some kind of ‚Äúpublic negotiations‚Äù, whatever he means by that.   üî∑Naturally, Zelensky is not an independent figure, so all his statements and actions have to be taken with a grain of salt. Limited negotiations on certain issues such as prisoner exchange are quite possible and some such exchanges have already been completed. Supplies of Russian ammonia fall under terms of the grain deal that Zelensky has already signed, so this should be taken for granted and not become subject of any negotiation.   üî∑This leaves the issue of peace talks. Starting positions of the parties are diametrically opposite as is their assessment of the situation. Russia does not have any reasons or incentives to start any negotiations on Ukrainian terms, so it has been obvious from the very beginning that such offer is doomed. Of course, Zelensky and, more importantly, his sponsors understand that at this moment of time Ukraine controls almost as much territory as it could hope to get, and ending the conflict with current status quo is the best deal for them. 

üî∑Public talks are likely to turn into another show of Zelensky that will bring no real results. Russian diplomats and Russian president won‚Äôt play his game, they are doing the real thing, not acting.   üî∑Zelensky and the collective West know that Russia never showed any signs of being ready to withdraw its own conditions for peace deal. They know that Ukrainian situation is really desperate and collapse of Ukrainian statehood is almost imminent. Russian attacks on dual-purpose infrastructure are yielding results and as Zelensky‚Äôs regime is not ready to accept reality, continued missile strikes will leave Ukraine in the dark in a matter of weeks.

üî∑Zelensky has only one way to save Ukraine from total collapse and this way is unconditional acceptance of Russian terms. Territory control won‚Äôt matter much when Kiev regime will lose its ability to move troops and supply forces in field.   üî∑His series of statements show that both Zelensky and his sponsors understand the real situation but are not ready to acknowledge defeat and still hope to fight Russia till the last Ukrainian.

This announcement was met with mixed reactions. Trump‚Äôs reputation in the U.S. is quite controversial and although there is a strong wing of Republican party that supports his ideas, many of them dislike Trump as a person and could prefer another candidate.
Considering that situation, Trump‚Äôs decision seems to be beneficial only for Trump and if he does manage to squeeze through Republican primaries, it is very likely that we will see the repeat of 2020 when many Americans were ready vote for a doormat if it wasn‚Äôt Donald Trump.

üî∑While the split in American society is good for Russia in the context of Russian-Ukrainian conflict and although Trump‚Äôs followers vouch for the end of U.S. involvement in Ukraine, it would be much better if Republicans chose another, less controversial candidate representing the same ideas, such as Florida governor DeSantis who became quite popular through his opposition to Biden‚Äôs decisions.

üî∑Next year will show who will oppose Trump at primaries and which wing of the Republican party will prevail. However, most international experts agree that although people of the United States are unhappy with Biden‚Äôs internal policies and his foreign involvement, Trump has low chances for victory in 2024 because of his controversial personality and background.   üî∑Isolationist wing of the Republican party stands for revival of U.S. industry and economy and reduced involvement of the United States in affairs of the rest of the world. This coincides with Russian vision of the future and although they are not friends of Russia, they represent the most reasonable part of the American society that Russia can deal with. Isolationist wing of the Republicans is currently the most popular, but Trump‚Äôs decision deals a serious blow to its chances to prevail on 2024 presidential elections.
Nomination of another candidate such as DeSantis means that isolationist voices will split and as the result they can lose primaries to neocons that will stand for further pressure on Russia and more aggressive activities to preserve American domination in the Western world.

ü§îSo, it will most likely be Donald Trump. While his nomination speech was quite moderate and lacked ‚ÄúTrumpisms‚Äù, even if he manages to go through the entire process, he will face the same restrictions as before and will be continuously accused of being Kremlin‚Äôs agent every times he will attempt to reconcile with Russia and achieve some deals with his Russian vis-√†-vis.

üî∑Many things may happen between now and the elections.

A new Bill in the Duma proposes to increase ""maternal capital"" (a programme of financial support for families). From the current 693k rubles ($11.5k USD), a lump sum for a second child in the family, to 933k ($15.5k USD). 

Payments for a third child in the family will be 1, 399 million rubles (or $23.5k USD). The program would also become ongoing (currently due to end in 2026). 

Recent years have seen a dip in natural (non-immigration) population numbers. There are less people of child-bearing age in the 2010-2020s, as there were less children born during the collapse of the USSR (30 years ago), than other generations.

More than four months into the war, humanitarian needs are continuing to multiply as the fighting continues. Children continue to be killed, wounded and deeply traumatized by the violence all around them. Many have seen things no child should ever see. Their homes have been hit. Their schools have been attacked, along with all the systems that could help them survive. Families are terrified, in shock, and desperate for safety.
By the middle of July, more than 6.2 million people were internally displaced, while more than 12.6 million refugees in Ukraine are looking for food, water and a safer place to stay.¬†

Distribution of votes was quite interesting, more on that later.

‚ûñUkrainian ambassador to UN said many nice words and spitted many unsubstantiated and unproven accusations, but the essence of his speech was ‚Äúwe want money‚Äù. As one of his references, he mentioned UN Compensation Commission (UNCC), established in 1991 following Iraq‚Äôs invasion and occupation of Kuwait, which recently completed its mandate and paid over $52 billion to ‚Äúvictims‚Äù. 

Speaking before the vote, Russian Ambassador Vasily Nebenzya characterized the draft resolution as ‚Äúa classic example‚Äù of a narrow group of States acting not on the basis of international law, but rather trying to consecrate something that is illegal. He said countries backing the resolution were attempting to position the General Assembly as a judicial body, which it is not. 

‚ÄúThese countries boast about how committed they are to the rule of law, but at the same time, they are flouting its very semblance‚Äù. 

‚ÄúThe UN will play no role in this process because the proposed mechanism is suggested to be created outside of the UN, and no one has any plans to account to the General Assembly for its activity,‚Äù he continued. 

‚òùÔ∏èAs he said, there is absolutely no doubt that the funding will come from frozen Russian assets. This goes in line with recent statements of EU‚Äôs von der Leyen about ‚Äúlooking for legal grounds‚Äù to seize Russian assets. 

‚ûñThe West has been long wanting to unfreeze these assets, however there are some serious doubts that they will be returned to owner or even spent on having Ukraine. Let‚Äôs not forget that the West has already supplied and is planning to supply Ukraine with so many weapons that even Russian reserves will barely cover it.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2511.0,3.0,2022-11-15T15:52:41+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityItalic,1105.0,331.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,432.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,432.0,,,,,MessageReplies,5.0,25478.0,False,[],,15564.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

‚òùÔ∏è Essentially it means that the cargo has been confiscated and used at the discretion of the confiscating entity. This is no way equivalent to being ‚Äúexempt from sanctions‚Äù.
Maybe it would be better to let Russia and Russian businesses decide whether they want to donate their property to the World Food Program or UN. 

‚ûñ As for Europe, it should either review its stance or end this hypocrisy and stop coming up with statements about Russia refusing to supply grain to blackmail the world with a threat of global hunger.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2631.0,4.0,2022-11-14T14:10:41+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,162.0,MessageEntityItalic,335.0,73.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,430.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,430.0,,,,,MessageReplies,5.0,25478.0,False,[],,15566.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

üí°‚ÄúStrana‚Äù has reported about planned preparation of Ukrainian banking system for total blackout lasting from several days to a month referring to a memorandum of the National bank of Ukraine. This memo instructs Ukrainian financial organizations to procure and install backup power sources, including diesel power plants with fuel reserve for at least a week.

üî∑This points that at least Ukrainian financial circles fully understand potential risks that are getting higher with every successful Russian strike on Ukrainian power grid and every decision of the Ukrainian president. Ukrainian authorities acknowledged that if Russian strikes will continue at the same rate, the power grid is bound to collapse before the end of year even if European Union doesn‚Äôt stop supplying power units.
However, failure of the banking system would be the least Ukrainian problem in case of blackout. Especially as this blackout is expected to occur in the middle of winter. Ukraine has not enough autonomous power sources for critical utilities and even if it had them, it does not have enough diesel fuel to run them. 

 üî∑With current level of damage Ukraine can either use the energy grid to maintain normal city life or to power electrical railways and industrial facilities. For now, Kiev government chose a middle way shutting down power for 5-10 hours a day in most Ukrainian cities.   

üî∑Further successful strikes make this choice even harder as longer blackouts in cold time of the year will inevitably cause a humanitarian crisis, a wave of refugees and collapse of Ukrainian ability to supply the front lines and move forces. The government will have to decide what to do with three million people in Kiev that will demand return to normal life.  

 üî∑If this scenario plays out, it will coincide with complete integration of Russian mobilized reservists into combat units in preparation for offensive. Combination of civil disturbance, blackouts and disrupted supplies will wear out the enemy units and may result in collapse of defenses. Despite all cocksure statements of Kiev government, Ukrainians are also tired of the conflict and a lot of them would welcome any compromise that would end their suffering. 

üî∑Naturally, if things go really bad, Ukraine can be connected to Russian energy system. The effect will not be immediate but in case if Ukraine suddenly listens to the voice of reason Russia has the capability to restore power in reasonable time.  

 üî∑Kiev regime is not ready to accept reality and deliberately creates a situation close to humanitarian crisis and keeps spitting ultimatums instead of accepting generous Russian offer to start negotiations without any preliminary conditions.   

üî∑Russian public is already tired of half-measures and is likely to approve decisive blow to Ukraine. Kiev takes Russian mercy for weakness, but it may be its last mistake when Russia runs out of patience. If things keep going this way, it‚Äôs quite possible that peace treaty with Russia will be signed by very different people.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2853.0,9.0,2022-11-14T08:23:21+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,22.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,428.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,428.0,,,,,MessageReplies,7.0,25478.0,False,[],,15567.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

‚òùÔ∏èAmidst numerous events of the past days and weeks and global focus on Ukrainian conflict the Western world seems to ignore things happening in other regions and Russian news seem to be forgetting about that as well.  

üëäMeanwhile, according to Arab News, on November 9th ‚Äúunknown force‚Äù has launched an air-strike on a truck convoy in eastern Syria killing a number of Iranian nationals protecting it. It was a transit convoy carrying Iranian oil to Lebanon through Syria. While US hasn‚Äôt confirmed its responsibility for this strike, it should be noted that in August the US military carried out airstrikes in Deir ez-Zor targeting Iran-backed militiamen. The Pentagon said the strikes were a message to Iran and Tehran-backed militias that targeted American troops earlier that month and several other times over the past year. 

 üî∑Right at the moment over two thousands of Syrian refugees are held in al-Rukban camp by US-controlled paramilitary forces. Americans have not allowed Russian experts to enter the camp to evaluate humanitarian situation.  

üî∑Back in September the US announced construction of another military base in oil-rich Syrian province of Deir ez-Zor. While the public of the Western world and virtually all Western media are focused on Ukrainian conflict, the United States keep illegally occupying North-Eastern Syria, they keep extracting Syrian oil and transporting it to Iraq, they keep attacking forces aligned with the government of Syria and show no signs of remorse or any desire to retreat.   

‚ùìWhere is the reaction of the global community to U.S. illegal occupation of Syria that continues for seven years? Where are sanctions against U.S., where are demands for US to compensate all Syrian oil that has been stolen and hauled to Iraq on road tankers? Where is the righteous rage of global community, where is European coalition urging for global peace? 

 üî∑Moreover, U.S. involvement in Syria can in no way be compared to Russian special operation in Ukraine. U.S. presence there is totally illegitimate and not justified by any international laws or any international bodies. There are no American people in Syria, Syrian government does not discriminate any ethnicities and endorses moderate secular branch of Islam unlike Jihadists supported by US weapons. The U.S. occupies a territory of an independent state and keeps bringing more and more troops and weapons to the occupied area, which also happens to be the most resource-rich area of the country.  

 üî∑In fact, U.S. involvement in Syria can be compared to U.S. involvement in Ukraine eight years ago ‚Äîarming anti-government insurgents, launching global media campaign against the government, promising all support to the opposition. They won in Ukraine but they didn‚Äôt yet win in Syria and decided to keep the sweet part of the country for themselves.  

üî∑Another parallel, U.S. intervention in Syria gave rise to ISIS and U.S. intervention in Ukraine gave rise to neo-Nazis. Maybe there is something wrong with U.S. interventions as they result in rise of the most notorious forces?  

üî∑As for Syria, there are little chances that U.S. forces will leave the country voluntarily. Russian protection prevents the new start of the civil war but as Russia focuses more on Ukraine remnants of Jihadist radicals may rise their heads once again.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1998.0,9.0,2022-11-14T08:25:33+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,19.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,423.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,423.0,,,,,MessageReplies,0.0,25478.0,False,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

üî∑On November 9th Russian Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu has ordered Russian forces to retreat from the city of Kherson to prepared defense positions on the left coast of Dnieper. The Minister said that life and health of Russian servicemen are always a priority.

üî∑This order followed report of General Surovikin who stated that while Russian Armed Forces successfully repeal all Ukrainian attempts of offensive in the area and have inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy, AFU keep launching strikes on schools, hospitals and civilian population of Kherson, which is currently being evacuated across the Dnieper. Surovikin stated that all civilians willing to evacuate have been evacuated and over 115,000 citizens have been transported to safety.

‚ùìWhat will this mean to the course of special operation? From military point of view it will stabilize the front line and allow Russian forces to concentrate on other areas avoiding losses in an attempt to hold Kherson with supply lines across the Dnieper being in the range of Ukrainian artillery. 

‚òùÔ∏èFrom PR point of view this retreat poses a serious problem. It is going to become a media victory for Ukraine. Although this retreat was not forced and is not a result of any military defeat, the West will surely present it as a big victory for Ukraine and will demonstrate Ukrainian sponsors that their money is not being spent in vain. It is unlikely that it will work for long, but Ukraine will try to use it as much as possible.

üî∑However, this should not be viewed as a defeat or a turn of the tide. While media victories are important, real victories are awaiting on the ground and inevitable Russian counter-offensive will put everything in place. General Surovikin has also reported about successful activity in Donbass and advances in this area are surely be more important.

üî∑It's easier to understand the decision of the Ministry of Defense looking at a broader scale. Ukraine is currently way overstretched and depends solely on support of the West and especially the U.S. With certain Republican victory on mid-terms it is very likely that this support will be reduced no matter what happens on the ground. 

üî∑In addition to that, Russian missile strikes are slowly and steadily disabling Ukrainian energy grid and if they continue at the same rate, the grid will suffer irreparable damage resulting in total blackout in a matter of weeks. This blackout would cause in total chaos and inevitable collapse of the frontline defenses. ¬†

üî∑Russian missile strikes also damage Ukrainian air defenses and ammunition storage facilities. When Ukrainian air defense falls below critical level, Russian Air Force will totally dominate Ukrainian skies without any opposition. When Ukrainian forces run out of sophisticated ammunition, they won‚Äôt be able to continue any resistance. 

üî∑In view of all those weak points of Ukraine, it is indeed not reasonable to suffer heavy losses trying to hold one city despite all its importance and symbolical value.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2046.0,3.0,2022-11-11T11:12:34+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,20.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,422.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,422.0,,,,,MessageReplies,6.0,25478.0,False,[],,15570.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

üá©üá™While German government keeps treading in toe with the U.S. on its relationship with Russia, public moods in Germany are gradually changing. 

üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èGermany has already seen a number of protests against EU sanctions on Russia like the one in Dresden on October 30th. Those thousands of Germans don‚Äôt want to starve or freeze for Ukrainian President Zelensky‚Äôs war that was provoked and engaged in by the U.S.A., E.U. and NATO. As Germany and Europe feel the pain of increasingly economic hardship, German and other European governments may finally start listening to public opinion and succumb to the pressure of their people.

‚ñ´Ô∏èFollowing Nord Stream attack staged by the U.K. and the U.S. German leader has already showed some spine against Joe Biden. While he is still too scared of making peace with Russia, he went openly defying Biden as far as China is concerned. 

‚ñ´Ô∏èNord Stream was damaged but when the truth was uncovered the outcome turned favorable for Russia and China. France‚Äôs Macron is openly speaking against US charging $1320 for the same gas that was charged $300 by Russia and Scholz sold a 25% stake of Hamburg Port to a Chinese company.

‚ñ´Ô∏èScholz literally braved all opposition by Blinken and his own minister Habeck and went to China against all odds. He went with many companies for a lot of business discussions. Scholz had refused the offer of President Macron to join him and present a common European approach in his recent visit to Beijing.

‚ñ´Ô∏èAlthough Scholz was not very well received in China, it‚Äôs worth noting that he told Xi Jingping to call on Putin to have a ceasefire on Ukraine. While it looks routine, in fact it means that a European leader asks Chinese leader to help establish peace ignoring the U.S. role completely. That‚Äôs an unimaginable loss of face for the U.S. from Chinese point of view.

‚ñ´Ô∏èSo, while Europe is not turning to Russia, there is some chance that Europe will turn away from U.S. and to the Eurasian initiatives. The other alternative is becoming economic slaves to U.S. oil companies as per our previous material. 

‚ñ´Ô∏èThe world is indeed on the brink of radical changes and maybe despite all their words, European leaders will see the choice that will be most beneficial for them. Economic slavery with America or mutual prosperity with China and Russia?

‚ñ´Ô∏èOf course, these moods are not yet prevalent in Europe and many countries are firmly set against any compromises with Russia, but as Germany and France are questioning their allegiance to the U.S. changes are inevitable.

‚ûñTypical Western propaganda keeps talking about NATO posing no threat to Russia and membership in NATO being a free choice of members and saying that Russia should have been forging better relations with its neighbors to prevent them from joining NATO. Many Americans and Europeans sincerely believe this. 

‚ûñThis is a problem of key difference in perception between the West and Russia. How could Russia know that NATO posed no threat? Because NATO said so? Russians saw more and more countries joining the alliance, Russians saw NATO military bases moving closer and closer to Russian borders. What should they think? That NATO are fluffy bunnies and don‚Äôt want to hurt anybody? 

‚ûñMaybe it was pure coincidence that leading NATO countries criticized Russian way of life, called Russia an authoritarian tyranny, accused Russia of imperialistic ambitions. They were constantly stating that Russia needs ‚Äúmore democracy‚Äù and used Russian relaxed laws to overwhelm the country with their NGOs, which supported street populists and most anti-government and anti-patriotic forces, including most notorious. 

‚ûñNATO actions very closely resembled scenarios of color revolutions that destroyed many countries and have not brought any good results in any single case. Maybe Russians should have believed that the West knows better how they should live, what should be their values and how should their country behave globally? 
Forging better relations is a great idea but nobody can say that Russia did not try it. However, these attempts were always met with strong opposition of NATO leaders. So how could Russia do it? With money? Money does not buy everything and Russia did not resort to cheap and empty promises, although that is what people really see. 

‚ûñLet‚Äôs take Ukraine. Russia subsidized Ukraine for decades ever since USSR collapse. Russia sometimes sold gas to Ukraine cheaper than to its local consumers, Russia provided Ukraine with cheap loans, Russia gave Ukraine trade preferences. Did it help? No. Why?

‚ûñNATO leaders have decades of experience in PR technologies and promoting their agenda. They control English-language mainstream media that cover more than half of the world. They are not charities, they don‚Äôt help countries, but promote bright pictures of their own prosperity and imply that it‚Äôs easy to get that. They are not saying anything about the real costs.

‚ûñFor example, Russia offered multi-billion orders to Ukrainian industry. The West offered nice European picture. Just join the West, join EU, join NATO and you‚Äôll be safe and prosperous. Sign this association agreement and you‚Äôll get rich next day. No need to look at real conditions. 

‚ûñWhat did Ukraine choose? And it‚Äôs not just Ukraine. Georgia and Moldova also took this road, Armenia changed its mind when it was already too late and Belarus avoided serious turmoil only because of its close integration with Russia.

‚ûñSo, did NATO pose a threat to Russia? Yes. NATO bases and arms in Europe presented military threat to Russia, while NATO countries attempted to interfere in Russian internal politics and actively worked to undermine Russian relations with neighboring countries.

‚ûñAs Ukrainian conflict rages on, Russian missile strikes continue to disrupt operation of Ukrainian energy grid. Every day there is air alert in at least several large cities if not all. Blackouts are becoming a common thing, people in Kiev has to spend from 5 to 10 hours without electricity. 

‚ûñUkraine‚Äôs president Zelensky ignores all Russian offers to return to negotiations and this means that these strikes will continue. European countries are helping Ukraine overcome the energy shortage, but it doesn‚Äôt really work. Total blackout is looming on the horizon and it is about to create one of the largest migration crisis in history.

‚ûñEven Ukrainian government urges Ukrainians to leave the country. That‚Äôs yet another sign of failed state, but that‚Äôs another topic. Anyway, there are not many places where Ukrainians can go ‚Äì it‚Äôs either Russia or the West. Despite all Western propaganda, millions of Ukrainians would still prefer Russia as they have friends and family ties there. However, it is unlikely that Ukrainian government will let them pass through the front lines unharmed or will let them ever come back. 
Therefore, all those millions of refugees are going West. Europe is already overwhelmed by Ukrainian refugees. Initially they were welcomed everywhere but as time passed, things started to change. In light of energy crisis European governments are encouraging all possible saving measures and subsidies to people hosting refugees are among those costs that can be cut down. 

‚ûñThe influx of Ukrainian migrants has already caused numerous problems. Ukrainians usually don‚Äôt speak languages of countries where they stay, they create extra burden on social security system of the host countries, they are trying to find jobs and work hard, but that is also not viewed very well. Energy crisis will inevitably increase the level of unemployment in Europe and locals won‚Äôt be happy about competition and dumping pressure from Ukrainians or anyone else.

‚ûñThe issue of housing is also pending. Very few Ukrainians managed to find any permanent place to live on their own, most are still using refugee camps or are hosted by hospitable Europeans. However, despite all this hospitability, this is not a permanent solution.

‚ûñThere will be problems even with the existing number of migrants, but if their number increases, the outcome will be catastrophic. Europe won‚Äôt be able to provide them normal living conditions, healthcare, schools, pensions, jobs. Even the richest countries such as UK, Germany and France are already facing budget problems because of energy crisis, inflation and numerous other issues. They are spending billions every month to subsidize housing, food, healthcare and schools for Ukrainian migrants, but those billions are needed elsewhere and, moreover, available resources are limited.

‚ûñZelensky is using the situation to blackmail Europeans demanding multi-billion subsidies and supply of energy and power grid equipment threatening to send more migrants across the border. Ukrainians don‚Äôt matter anything to him or his clique. Although Ukrainian nationalists are hysterical about their ethnic superiority, it seems they don‚Äôt mind if their people become nomads and will get involved in various unqualified if not criminal jobs in the ‚Äúcivilized West‚Äù.

There is 2 notions we need to know; De juro and De Facto
De Juro means LEGAL, or according to the law. 
De Facto means , what is actually going on. ( not based on the law) 
Russia is accused to violate international law. Law that is stipulated in UN charter. 
Accusations  that have been made by  the presidents and high-ranking politicians in US and  European countries. 
It is a bit complicated to explain the full scope of legality in the matter so let me present a light version. 

The USSR is still exiting De Juro. 
But De Facto it is gone and we have 15 sovereign republics in the post Soviet space. 

The fall of the USSR is the result of illegal actions of Gorbatjov. 
There is a lawsuit pending against him. A grassroots organization is gathering 1 million signatures to follow with the lawsuit. 
People are asking the Supreme Court of Russian Federation to give a legal assessment to Gorbatjov actions. 
When the ruling comes, Russia will withdraw the recognition of Ukrainian sovereignty and the matter will become an internal affair of RF. 
All according to the international law. 
This is a lawful and peaceful solution to the conflict. 

After that, all party‚Äôs involved in military conflict will have to stop weapons delivery and leave Ukraine.

‚ùóÔ∏èThe notion for inviolability of borders in Europe has been established by the Helsinki Act of 1975, which also rejected any use of force or intervention in internal affairs and urged the signatories to respect human rights.

‚òùÔ∏èThis Act lasted until 1990 when West Germany (FRG) annexed East Germany (GDR). This was followed by collapse of USSR, collapse of Yugoslavia, split of Czechoslovakia, Balkan wars, civil conflicts in ex-USSR, Kosovo and Russian reunion with Crimea.

‚ûñIt looks like inviolability of borders is in fact a myth that has never been true. Nations evolve, countries evolve, people change. Especially if we stop considering Europe to be something special. Post-WW2 world order stayed for almost 40 years, yet many borders were revamped and changed during and after that. 

‚ûñHistory knows many examples of Empire dismantling and when it happens quickly (like dissolution of Austro-Hungary) , this resulted in more conflicts in future (pre-WW2 and WW2 changes of borders in Southern Europe). Same about collapse of the Ottoman Empire that caused chaos in the Middle East and issues that are still existing (Armenians expelled from core Armenia, no state for Kurds). British Empire was dismantled in a more orderly way, but there still were conflicts.

‚ûñSo there is no wonder that not everyone on post-USSR space is happy with administrative and territorial division of the USSR. Especially since this division was arbitrary changed many times during communist rule. It happened so that Ukrainian SSR got a number of core Russian regions from USSR.

‚ûñYes, USSR‚Äôs administrative borders were recognized and everything was fine as long as we were parts of the same Soviet Union and the same nation of Soviet people. It really mattered only for administrative purposes and no conflicts were really serious. By the way, even Karabakh conflict wasn‚Äôt a thing in USSR times, and Armenians and Azerbaijani were not THAT hostile to each other because they both were a part of something greater. 

‚ûñSo, USSR gave Ukraine Russian lands and post-Soviet Russia acknowledged it. However, this acknowledgment lasted only while Ukraine remained a friendly or neutral state and was a part of post-Soviet integration projects, such as the mostly impotent CIS. 

‚ûñIn 2022 Russia got out of patience with Ukrainian hostility and now Russians are back for their lands.

ü§îRussia probably didn‚Äôt do things the right way in some sense. It could have prepared formal territorial claims, withdrawn recognition of Ukraine and done other things to really legitimize its actions and formalize its demands. Russian public would probably see it as pointless waste of time, but that would be as important as running referendums on new territories.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1981.0,7.0,2022-11-08T10:05:21+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,5.0,89.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,414.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,414.0,,,,,MessageReplies,5.0,25478.0,False,[],,15577.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

‚ûñ The longest period of peace in Europe lasted from 1945 to 1991 and was the accomplishment of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics that defeated Nazi Germany and established balance of power inside Europe. 

‚ûñThis power balance of bipolar world was the only thing that prevented open wars between countries ‚Äì countries within one block wouldn‚Äôt fight each other and would avoid local violence because it could trigger interference of the other block. There were few really neutral states but as the blocks were constantly ready for war with each other, there was no war. 

‚ûñThe balance of power in Europe was destroyed in 1989-1991 with dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union. The Soviet side has voluntarily decided to stop confrontation and made a giant step to stable peace based not on mutual assured destruction but on trust and cooperation. However, the other side was not so noble and simply declared itself a winner and started enjoying the spoils. The balance of power shifted and the strongest side thought that it has a right to decide the issues of war, peace and the way that other countries should follow.

‚ûñNow, which ‚Äúevery‚Äù nations have exactly signed for peace in Europe? NATO countries? The ones that bombed Yugoslavia, which is a European country just a bit over 20 years ago? It‚Äôs not that much. 20 years is not ‚Äúlasting peace‚Äù. 

‚ûñAnd Europe is more than just that. Is Artsakh not Europe? Is Armenia not Europe? What about Georgia? Some other continent? There have been no ‚Äúpeace in Europe‚Äù ever since the fall of the Warsaw pact. 

‚ûñOne more thing ‚Äì why is Europe so special? Why should it be safe from conflicts? How is it better than the Middle East or Africa or Asia? Conflicts don‚Äôt come out of nowhere. They come when nations see no other options. Russians are doing what they have to do. They weren‚Äôt the one who started violence. Violence was started by Russian enemies and Russia is ending it.
By the way, the only continent that had internal peace like forever is Australia. Maybe Australian indigenous people would disagree, but we can‚Äôt ask Tasmanian people about it anymore.

Since the beginning of the special operation, the US armed forces have sent to Ukraine: 142 155-mm M777 howitzers, 35 105-mm howitzers, 20 120-mm mortars, 38 HIMARS MLRS, 63,000 ATGM systems, MANPADS ‚Äî 1.4 thousand, as well as 15 Mi-17 helicopters, 46 radar stations, 10.2 thousand machine guns and pistols and 26 patrol boats.

Naturally, in addition to the weapon itself, it was necessary to supply ammunition for it. Previously, Readovka has already made infographics with the supply of artillery ammunition to Ukraine. Now, information has been made public on the supply of small arms ammunition - about 68.2 million rounds of ammunition were transferred to the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine by the Pentagon.

The equipment chartered by the Pentagon was engaged in providing these transportations. So, 47 ships, 114 trains and 3.4 thousand trailers were involved. Transport aviation made 845 flights. In total, about 85,000 tons of weapons have been delivered to Ukraine since the beginning of the conflict.

‚ûñThis economic war was not declared by Russia, so Russia has not set any objectives for it. Europe did declare economic war on Russia that took the form of massive anti-Russian sanctions. When these sanctions were initially announced, their declared objectives were ‚Äúto cripple Russian war machine and Russian economy making it impossible for Russia to continue military activities in Ukraine‚Äù and to ‚Äústimulate regime change in Russia‚Äù. 

‚ûñSo, since Russian economy is getting better every month and Russian defense industry is working three shifts with noticeably increased production volumes as compared to previous year, it does not look like this crippling objective has worked to any noticeable extent. Russian military is fully supplied and stocked with all necessary equipment and ammunitions, there have been no reports of any shortages. 

‚ûñWhile the government appreciates support of volunteers and army support funds, it has several times announced that there is no need for any extra financial commitments by citizens or organizations. When several regions have proposed to cancel New Year celebrations and send saved money to the army, the Kremlin has officially stated that this should not be even considered. 

‚ûñAs time went by, Europeans have invented another objective ‚Äî to get fully independent on Russian energy resources and substitute Russia with other suppliers. Despite the fact that Russia has been a stable and reliable supplier for many decades, Europeans decided to break those ties all at once. Even then, Russia did not terminate supplies immediately and is in fact supplying energy to Europe even now with some routes running through Ukraine.

‚ûñAnyway, this objective has been virtually achieved. Europe is getting independent of Russian energy, Russian food and Russian everything. As for the costs and consequences‚Ä¶ it doesn‚Äôt look like Europe ever thought about it. European governments are surely not going hungry, unlike their people.
Let‚Äôs take an example of the United Kingdom, which is one of the most active proponents of anti-Russian sentiments in Europe and is suspected of direct acts of sabotage against Russian and German infrastructure.

‚ûñToday Russian ministry of defense has announced that Russia resumes it participation in ‚Äúthe grain deal‚Äù upon receiving sufficient guarantees of safety. It‚Äôs worth noting that withdrawal from the grain deal was the result of outrageous terrorist attack on Russian Black Sea fleet at the port of Sevastopol that was staged under cover of the ‚Äúgrain corridor‚Äù.

‚ûñSince it doesn‚Äôt look like Russia was pressured, this probably means that proposed guarantees and benefits were indeed serious. It‚Äôs worth noting that Turkey was very active in its attempts to revive the grain deal as one of its beneficiaries. Since Russian-Turkish relations are very important in light of Russian conflict with the West, it seems that President Erdogan managed to convince the Russian side to give the deal another chance.

What are the pros and cons of Russian return to the grain deal? 

‚ûñThere are several possible benefits. First of all, there must be some guarantees and benefits that aren‚Äôt yet publicized. Second, this gives a great boost to Erdogan and potentially a great profit to Turkey, which is now set to become both gas hub and grain hub for the Europe getting a serious leverage over it. While strengthening of Turkey is not directly beneficial to Russia, this makes it much likelier that Turkey will remain neutral and will keep blocking certain NATO initiatives such as adding Finland and Sweden to the alliance. 

‚ûñThere is also a humanitarian aspect of the deal. While Russia could supply some of its grain to the poorest countries and did commit to do it, the whole existence of the grain corridor did positively impact global prices on grain and reduced the risks of hunger in regions susceptible to those risks.

‚ûñAnother benefit is about guarantees given by Ukraine. To resume the deal, Ukraine provided written guarantees that it will not use the grain corridor for further terrorist attacks. Firstly, it looks like these guarantees were given not only to Russia but also to Turkey and the UN. It is quite likely that Ukraine will once again attempt terrorist attack on Russian Black Sea fleet or Crimea or that its Anglo-Saxon backers will push it to such an attack. If such thing happens, it will deal a huge blow to Ukrainian image and all Ukrainian guarantees and statements thus strengthening Russian positions. 

‚ûñSecond, the very fact of these guarantees means that Ukraine has implicitly acknowledged its responsibility for the previous attack. This guarantee is indirect proof of that, so Ukrainian image of being all nice has already suffered. Even if Ukraine tries again, Russian forces will still stay on alert so it is unlikely that Russia will suffer any serious damage because of this decision. 

‚ûñThird, return to the grain deal nullifies the European initiative to arrange grain transportation over land routes through Moldova. Black Sea route is much less complicated, much simpler and makes sure that at least some grain gets to those who really need it and doesn‚Äôt end in Europe in its entirety. 

‚ûñThe fourth aspect is more about military situation in the Black Sea. Without grain corridor Ukraine could return to the practice of laying mines around its coast in Odessa area, which would create obstacles not only for sea transports but also for possible Russian naval operations in that area.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1782.0,3.0,2022-11-03T16:08:36+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,27.0,MessageEntityBold,834.0,66.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,402.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,402.0,,,,,MessageReplies,0.0,25478.0,False,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I love Russia even more than I ever did before, and that's saying a lot.
A student of Russian and CCCP history, I agree with Putin that humanity has arrived at a crossroads of either liberating itself from one of the most barbarous empires in history or succumbing to complete enslavement to it.

With the dissolution of the CCCP, the checks and balances on Western hegemony were lost and the US-NATO has been rampaging round the globe, illegally invading and bombing country after country, occupying any that opposed US dictates, pirating national resources, and killing and displacing tens of millions of people that got in the way.

‚ûñThe broad geopolitical objective of Russia is getting its rightful place in the emerging world order and to make sure that all countries in the world will benefit from it. The time of unipolar world is over and Russia has its own vision of the world that is yet to come. 

‚ùóÔ∏èRussian conflict is not with the West, Russia has no aim to destroy the West or change the Western way of life, their values. Russian aim is to preserve its own way of life and its own values and let other countries have their way.

‚òùÔ∏èVladimir Putin in his recent speech has stated new vision of reality:

‚ÄúCollapse of the Soviet Union destroyed equilibrium between geopolitical forces. The West felt as a winner and proclaimed the unipolar world order where only its own will, culture and interests had the right to exist.
The historic period of total global domination of the West is coming to an end, unipolar world is becoming a thing of the past. We are standing on a historical boundary and the next decade will probably be the most dangerous, the most unpredictable and at the same time the most important decade since the end of the World War 2. The West is unable to control the humankind but desperately tries to do it, while most nations of the world no longer desire it. This is the main conflict of the new age. To quote classic words, we have a revolutionary situation: the top cannot and the bottom doesn‚Äôt want to live this way.
Russia is not challenging Western elites ‚Äì Russia is simply defending its right of existence and free development. We are not going to become a new hegemon. Russia does not propose to replace unipolar world with bipolar, tripolar, etc. or replace domination of the West with domination of the East, the North or the South. This would inevitably bring us to a new dead end.‚Äù
No wonder, that Putin‚Äôs October speech was welcomed and highly acclaimed in most third world countries, while the West didn‚Äôt publicize it and made it go below the radar of mass media, which focused attention on other parts of his speech distorting them to vilify Russia. 
Russian geopolitical objective is freedom ‚Äî freedom for Russia and any other country to develop in its own way without ideological or moral pressure of self-proclaimed global moral authorities. Economic and political independence are extremely important to avoid neocolonialism disguised as globalism, but ideological independence is the core and it should come first.

üëå To some extent. It is quite possible that Western leaders think this way. They view this trade as a benefit. Maybe they could use this option as leverage in negotiations with Russia, but they can‚Äôt use this carrot to make Russia accept an ultimatum. 

‚ûñRussian concerns still have to be addressed and a solution has to be developed for each of the four objectives that Russia has established for the special operation in Ukraine. 
Now, when dust has settled, Russians no longer think that trade with the West is a ‚Äúcarrot‚Äù, many view it as a ‚Äúpoison apple‚Äù that resulted in destruction of Russian industry. Resuming trade with the West looks an easy way to improve and grow Russian economy, but the easy way isn‚Äôt always the right way.

‚ûñLooking at consequences of disruption of trade with Russia for the collective West, we could in fact say that it is Russia that could use ‚Äúresuming trade‚Äù as a carrot to bring the West to negotiation table if Russians want it. 

‚ûñWhile Russia sure had to deal with some problems as the result of sanctions and disruption of supply chains, it does not look like Russia is having any serious problems with its internal economy. Inflation has stabilized after a spike in the beginning of year and there are no shortages of any vital consumer goods. 
Russia has survived the most dangerous period of crisis and severance of economic ties with the West without noticeable losses. The bottom point is already behind us and things are getting better and better with every month. 

‚ûñAs for the West, it is not monolithic with this regard. While the United States did not have any serious problems because of breaking ties with Russia and even managed to capitalize on it, for Europe the situation is different. 

‚ûñThe United States are still facing an economy crisis and potential recession, but it has more to do with economic policies of the incumbent President than with anything that is going on in the Eastern hemisphere. The longer this situation lasts, the more American people want to see the government focus on internal problems instead of spending money somewhere on another side of the world. 

‚ûñAs for Europe, its economy was much more intertwined with Russian and severance of ties did create serious problems, which have not fully manifested yet. It turned out that while sheer volume of trade with Russia was not so high, it was import of Russian energy that made the wheels of European economy running. Without Russian supplies European industrial machine faced problems and those are not short-term problems that can be fixed with emergency measures but a critical issue that could result in total collapse of European industry. 

‚ûñFor now, Europe is just paying whatever it takes to keep things running. This is an emergency approach and it works to an extent unless another emergency happens. However, this is not a viable long-term solution because it undermines competitiveness of European industry and economy. Unlike Russia, Europe is not self-sufficient in terms on energy. 

ü§îSo, the West can offer Russia fancy brands and shiny stuff and Russia can offer the West much needed energy that is vital to make those shiny things.

‚úçÔ∏è Today a group of Russian bloggers have sent a request to President Vladimir Putin asking to review the decision of blocking certain social networks, specifically Instagram and Facebook (owned by Meta, prohibited in the Russian Federation, classified as an extremist organization). Similar request was sent to Dmitry Medvedev, Deputy Chairman of Russian Security Council.

‚òùÔ∏èBloggers pointed out that a lot of Russian people still use those social networks through VPN services and that these social networks are primarily used for entertainment purposes. They think that there is no need to waste resources on blocking if this block does not have any meaningful impact.
Oleg Matveychev, deputy head of State Duma committee on IT, information policies and communication, commented that unblocking Instagram and Facebook is out of the question. He explained that these networks aren‚Äôt created for the pleasure of bloggers and are currently being used as information weapon against the Russian Federation.

‚ûñKremlin‚Äôs spokesman Dmitry Peskov has stated that this letter was not received yet and Kremlin has no comments on the subject so far. 

‚ûñShould Russia indeed unblock those resources? It doesn‚Äôt look like so because they were blocked for a very good reason. The platform firmly took Ukrainian side in the present conflict and openly permitted calls for violence against Russian people. There are legal grounds for blocking these resources in Russia and as long as these grounds exist, unblocking seems unlikely.

‚ûñSo called ‚Äúentertainment‚Äù in those networks is entwined with propagandist information. Those bloggers probably don‚Äôt understand that Russia is a target of massive disinformation campaign and that Russian users will immediately become targets of crooks and hackers of all sort at the very least. In fact, this block saves Russian people from manipulations and disinformation and deprives Ukraine and their Western sponsors of a powerful propaganda tool. 

‚ûñThese social networks have access to user location and users from Russia will most certainly face persecution, humiliation and attacks from mass audience of the collective West, which greatly outnumbers Russian internet audience. 

‚ûñSome say that Russian users could help promote Russian point of view and show the real truth to the Western audience, and this point could be valid if Meta* was a truly independent and impartial platform where everyone had equal opportunities to express their views. However, as Meta* platforms are proven to be biased, impartial treatment is not guaranteed and Russian users will just get lost in the sea of hate. 

‚ûñWhat Russia should really do is to extend its presence in the web and boost its own alternative social networks. While Russian language audience is more or less covered, Russia also needs an outlet to explain its points to the global audience. Despite many initiatives of the kind and certain successes, existing projects do not have global scale and have really limited capabilities on that level. The government can do a lot to support those initiatives as well as other ways to promote the Russian side in the world, but all this has to be well-thought and well-coordinated. 

‚ûñWe live in 21st century and information space is extremely important part of our world. The collective West managed to get hold of the most popular global platforms with China being second. This gives the collective West a way to influence public opinion of more than a half of global population. Russia really should not neglect this field because it often translates into real-world results.

‚ûñShould Russia unblock Facebook? No, not while it stays the way it is. Unblocking it won‚Äôt bring benefits to the Russian cause and may create risks for the Russian people.
Instead Russia should better actively look for alternatives that would allow it to dispute Western mainstream narratives about the ongoing conflict and other relevant things.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1998.0,7.0,2022-11-02T12:15:08+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,1.0,41.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,396.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,396.0,,,,,MessageReplies,14.0,25478.0,False,[],,15587.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

‚ûñDespite all the image of superhero created for him by media Zelensky is well, just a human. He‚Äôs not a great leader or something, he is not an ideologist, a great administrator, a genius of economics. It happened so that his charisma and acting skills brought him popularity, he managed to draw attention of a powerful oligarch and someone had an idea that an actor who played president in a TV show can play president in real life. And so it happened. He‚Äôs probably not particularly good or evil, he‚Äôs just a hostage to circumstances and to forces that are really pulling the strings.

‚ûñEven if he wanted to play his own game, he has no real support team, he has no advisors of his own, he is just surrounded by representatives of various forces in Ukraine. Perhaps, if he really played the political game and started at least from governor level, he could gather his own support base and become a real president. Now he is playing a tough national leader and is under continuous and extreme stress. There are rumors that he is taking serious stimulators to maintain the ability to work in this circumstances.

‚ûñWe don‚Äôt know what Zelensky really thinks about the present situation. It is likely that he oversees the information war against Russia and it‚Äôs no small feat that he managed to get an upper hand here and make the entire Western world rally against him. While he still completely depends on other forces within Ukraine, he made himself useful as a fund raiser for those forces. Getting hold several hundred billions is really an achievement to be proud about, even if you only have to fool your superiors for that.
Since Ukraine has turned into a black hole where the authorities control the law, nobody can really be sure where all these money and weapons end. Nobody will find out if something disappears elsewhere. Zelensky surely has a backup plan and won‚Äôt stay in the country if things go really wrong.

‚ûñIf Zelensky indeed had some strength and independence, he should inspire himself from Slobodan Miloshevich, who is still blamed today by some to have surrendered his country to NATO in June 1999 while the army was still fighting. Still, Serbia was not a match to NATO just like Ukraine is not a match to Russia and his decision did save a lot of lives that would otherwise be lost in hopeless war. 

‚ûñZelensky regime started playing a game that it cannot finish by itself. While Zelensky did manage to attract a lot of sponsors, he has no results to demonstrate them and they are slowly losing interest in this clown show from parallel reality. Zelensky must understand that his puppeteers will not stand behind him till the end and that Russia will not accept from Ukraine anything less than NATO accepted from Yugoslavia.

‚òùÔ∏èFreedom is a very vague term and sometimes even has negative meaning. Freedom to do anything you like is not a freedom to fight for, it‚Äôs a manifestation of chaos and anarchy.

‚ûñ Now, let‚Äôs talks about freedoms in Ukraine. There is a fundamental concept of 4 freedoms that are considered as the foundation stone of all democratic values in the West. This concept was formulated by U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt and these freedoms are: freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, freedom from fear. 

‚ûñ Did Ukraine have all those freedoms before this conflict started? Note that even any unjustified restriction is a restriction. 

‚ûñSo, let‚Äôs start with the freedom of speech. Did Ukraine have it? Bad news for Ukraine lovers but no, it did not. In fact, Ukrainians could not publicly express any points of view that contradicted the official government agenda without fearing persecution and some statements like acknowledgment of Russian ownership of Crimea were directly criminalized. One of the most notorious crimes in Ukraine in last 8 years was murder of a Oles Buzina, a Ukrainian journalist, a true patriot of his country who saw Ukraine‚Äôs future on a common path with Russia.

‚ûñWhat about freedom of worship? Well, things are a bit better with that in Ukraine. You can follow any religion, you can become a member of any sect, you can even openly embrace neo-Nazi ideology and demonstrate Nazi symbols in public. Still, there is one exception and this exception is Russian Orthodox Church. Priests and followers of Russian Orthodox Church have been persecuted, their churches were seized in West Ukraine and they were openly killed in Donbass where Ukrainian artillery indiscriminately fired on sacred buildings as well as on everything else. 

‚ûñHow about freedom from want? Well, it looks like ever since the 2014 coup quality of life for Ukrainian people has been going down, and down, and down. By 2022 about 10 million Ukrainian citizens were working in other countries. Purchasing power of hryvna fell by several times. Industries have been destroyed beyond repair, ‚Äúeconomical reforms‚Äù of the government constituting in taking more and more debts and selling everything they could sell and then trying to sell it again, as it happened with famous ‚ÄúMotor Sich‚Äù plant in Zaporozhye that Ukrainian government first sold to Chinese and then ‚Äúchanged their mind‚Äù. 
Finally comes the freedom from fear. Well, some Ukrainians surely enjoy this freedom. Radical nationalists, criminals, members of terrorist battalions definitely didn‚Äôt fear anyone or anything in Ukraine ever since 2014 and up to 2022. They were free to do almost anything they want with government turning blind eye on them and justice system giving probation terms for brutal murders such as the above-mentioned murder of Oles Buzina, whose killers are publicly known and were not just enjoying freedom but working for the cabinet of ministers of Ukraine and its security services. Dozens of thugs in national clothes have several times stormed the court building and openly terrorized and threatened judges until all of them refused to open a case against those people. 

‚ûñWell, looking at the above, we can say that Ukraine does have all those freedoms but they are reserved only for a limited category of people. And this is the very category of people that Russia is fighting against ‚Äî radicals that do not value human life and put themselves above laws and above anything else.

‚ùóÔ∏èRussia is not trying to use food supplies as weapon. Withdrawal from the grain deal was the result of outrageous terrorist attack on Russian Black Sea fleet at the port of Sevastopol that was staged under cover of the ‚Äúgrain corridor‚Äù. 

‚ûñRussian Ministry of defense has analyzed data from navigation modules of captured underwater drones and this analysis confirmed that the drones were launched from the coast near Odessa and were moving along the ‚Äúsafe corridor‚Äù established under the ‚Äúgrain deal‚Äù and then changed their course and moved on to attack Russian fleet. 

‚ûñSince the ‚Äúgrain deal‚Äù was used to cover hostile military activities, it means that initiators of this attack have broken the deal and rendered it invalid. Russian Ministry of Defense announced that it has solid proof of involvement of Ukraine and UK in the attack and Russia has officially requested a Security Council meeting on the matter.

‚ûñIt's worth noting that possible UK involvement in Black Sea attack as well as in North Stream attack that could be executed with similar drones may result in dire escalation of the conflict. The West has dismissed all accusations and evidence, following its traditional pattern of behavior, and this makes the present situation very alarming. 

‚ûñRussia would not come up with public accusations without proof and high confidence in actual involvement of the British in this terrorist attacks. However, if the West will just ignore the accusations and proofs, Russia will face a dangerous dilemma. If Russia ignores possible involvement of UK in the incident and will let it go without consequences, it will encourage further actions of this kind. On the other hand, any response may be considered an act of aggression against NATO country and ultimately result in next world war.

‚ûñ Anatoly Antonov, Russian ambassador in the U.S. has commented on the matter and on accusations in weaponizing the food deal: 

‚ÄúWashington's reaction to the terrorist attack on the port of Sevastopol is truly outrageous. We have not seen any signs of condemnation of the reckless actions by the Kiev regime. Instead, all the indications that the British military specialists were involved in organizing today's massive strike with the use of drones, are disregarded.
 The situation has escalated even further. But in the U.S., they do not intend to acknowledge this. Again, everything is reduced to false accusations that our country is exacerbating the global food problem. In the face of attacks and provocations against Russian military and merchant vessels involved in the ‚ÄúBlack Sea Initiative‚Äù, we cannot turn a blind eye to security issues and continue working. It is unfair to condemn Russia in suspending the implementation of the deal. This happened because of the reckless actions by the Ukrainian authorities‚Äù.
Russia has already announced that it will supply 500,000 tons of its own grain to poorest countries of Africa free of charge. Considering the fact that a large part of Ukrainian grain that was exported under the ‚Äúgrain deal‚Äù ended up in European countries, this could mean that countries that really need this grain will get even more than they could expect. 

‚ûñAnatoly Antonov put it this way: ‚ÄúAs for the insinuations about ‚Äúprovoking‚Äù hunger, we would like to remind you of our repeated calls to send food shipments, first of all, to countries in need. Instead, however, a good half of all carriers under the ‚Äúgrain deal‚Äù went to developed countries. While Somalia, Ethiopia, Yemen, Sudan and Afghanistan received only about 3% of the volume of agricultural products‚Äù.

‚ûñThe current grain deal is over. Ukrainian attack staged by its Western sponsors has ruined it. Russia could possibly discuss a possibility of a new grain deal but it will need much better guarantees and it will be very hard to convince Russia to resume it. And firstly, before any talks take place the West really got to explain involvement of the United Kingdom in the incidents.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2432.0,18.0,2022-10-31T08:59:24+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,91.0,MessageEntityItalic,2020.0,1257.0,MessageEntityItalic,3309.0,380.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,389.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,389.0,,,,,MessageReplies,7.0,25478.0,False,[],,13785.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Message,13576,1639836943,2022-10-22T06:17:09+00:00,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"üí• Die Welle der Wahrheit nimmt weiter an Intensit√§t zu und wird wohl in den kommenden Wochen des Jahres 2022 ihren H√∂hepunkt erreichen. In Frankreich hat der hei√üe Herbst l√§ngst begonnen, die Proteste nehmen weiter zu und in Gro√übritannien droht der Regierung nach dem R√ºcktritt von Truss der Kollaps. Russland ruft ein einigen Regionen das Kriegsrecht aus, w√§hrend ein UN-Bericht die Verbrechen der ukrainischen Armee aufzeigt. Neben der √ºblichen Kriegspropaganda wird eine baldige Niederlage der Ukraine immer mehr medial aufbereitet. 

üí• In Deutschland ist der Absturz in vollem Gange und es wird wiederholt mitgeteilt, dass mit den Waffenlieferungen eine rote Linie √ºberschritten wurde. Manche sehen bereits seit geraumer Zeit die Vorbereitung auf eine baldige Kapitulation. Die Cum-Ex-Ermittlungen bei der Deutscher Bank weiten sich aus und nicht nur bei von der Leyen zieht sich die Schlinge immer enger. Die Bundesregierung will Erkenntnisse zur Nord-Stream-Sprengung aus Gr√ºnden des Staatswohls geheim halten, was f√ºr immer mehr Fragen sorgt.                                                                   

üí• W√§hrend die Gr√ºnen Millionen ins Elend st√ºrzen, l√§sst die Sekte alle Hemmungen fallen und die Klima-Hysterie und Doppelmoral wird mal wieder offensichtlich. W√§hrend von Experten vorm Bundestag verk√ºndet wird, dass Kohlendioxid und menschliche Verbrennung haben keinen Einfluss auf das Klima haben, feiern die Gr√ºnen das Ende des deutschen Wohlstandes und entlarven sich mit brisanten Aussagen zum Nordstream-Anschlag. Nicht nur Habecks durchsichtige Realit√§tskonstruktion l√§sst darauf schlie√üen, dass Demagogie bzw. Ideologie dumm macht. Medial wird der gro√üe Widerspruch der Klimak√§mpfer aufgezeigt und Analogien zwischen Klimaextremisten und der jungen RAF bzw. eine entsprechende kriminelle Energie der Klimasekte festgestellt.                                                                                                

üí• Der Deutsche Bundesrat erkl√§rt Covid-19 bei Kindern  f√ºr unbedenklich, die √Ñrzte f√ºr Aufkl√§rung fordern eine sofortige Aussetzung der Impfung und trotz allem l√§sst die EMA Impfungen f√ºr Babys zu. Die Impfwerbung wird immer bizarrer und Lauterbach holt sich Hilfe von einem Long-Covid-Opfer vom Spiegel, um mit vermeintlichen Impfsch√§den f√ºrs Impfen zu werben. Long Covid dient vielen noch als bequeme Universalerkl√§rung, w√§hrend die Nebenwirkungen weltweit durch die Decke gehen. Die Welt meldet einen ‚Äûalarmierenden Trend‚Äú bei der Lebenserwartung der Deutschen.                                                                                                        

üí• Die Propaganda, die bereits zu Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts funktionierte, ""entfaltet heute eine noch immensere Wirkkraft"". Es gibt die gro√üe Angst vor den Andersdenkenden und manch einer f√ºhlt sich wie in Orwells 1984. Die Selbstentlarvungsperformance ist weiter in vollem Gange und es werden unter Applaus Pr√ºgel f√ºr Impfgegner gefordert. Prominent sind Wagenknecht, die regelm√§√üig mit den ‚Äûgr√ºn-affinen Lifestyle-Linken‚Äú abrechnet, Dieter Bohlen und Richard David Precht, die wegen kritischer Aussagen medial fertiggemacht werden und nat√ºrlich das perfekte Opfer russischer Propaganda sind.                                                                                                                                                       

üí• In Amerika bekommt Hunter Bidens ""laptop from hell"" immer mehr Aufmerksamkeit und wird dem Kongress samt entsprechender Beweise vorgelegt. Gleichzeitig zeigt sich Gishlaine Maxwell gespr√§chsbereit und ist offensichtlich bereit auszupacken. Beim Durham-Prozess wird Danchenko freigesprochen, was ein enormes Aufweckpotential mit sich bringt. Am Ende des Informationskrieges sieht man immer wieder Falschmeldung √ºber das Verh√§ltnis Trump zu Epstein, wor√ºber in diesem Artikel recht gut aufgekl√§rt wird und zum Verh√§ltnis Russlands zum WEF, deren Partnerschaft l√§ngst beendet ist.

‚ñ™Ô∏èArbeitslosigkeit. Etwa 50 % der Ukrainer sind in Polen besch√§ftigt, 15 % in Frankreich. Die Arbeit ist meist schlecht bezahlt und entspricht nicht der Ausbildung und den Qualifikationen; die Anerkennung von Diplomen und Ausbildungen ist nicht vorgesehen. 

‚ñ™Ô∏è Wohnungsmangel. Die Bereitschaft von Privatpersonen zur Aufnahme von Fl√ºchtlingen nimmt ab, einige L√§nder und Gemeinden weigern sich, Asyl zu gew√§hren. Die polnischen Beh√∂rden haben mit der Schlie√üung einiger Fl√ºchtlingszentren begonnen und den Zugang zu einem Programm eingeschr√§nkt, das Familien f√ºr die Unterbringung von Fl√ºchtlingen bezahlt. St√§dte in Deutschland weigern sich in einigen F√§llen, mehr Ukrainer aufzunehmen. Theoretisch steht es den Fl√ºchtlingen frei, sich √ºberall in Deutschland niederzulassen. In der Praxis erhalten sie jedoch nur dann staatliche Unterst√ºtzung, wenn sie sich bereit erkl√§ren, einem der 16 Bundesl√§nder auf der Grundlage eines Quotensystems zugewiesen zu werden. 

‚ñ™Ô∏è Der Mangel an Schulpl√§tzen. Es gibt keine genauen Daten dar√ºber, wie viele Kinder nicht an europ√§ischen Schulen eingeschrieben sind. Einigen Sch√§tzungen zufolge geht die Zahl in die Hunderttausende. 

üîôVon den 7,5 Millionen Fl√ºchtlingen ist fast die H√§lfte bereits in die Ukraine zur√ºckgekehrt, 4,5 Millionen bleiben in Europa. 

üö´Niemand in Europa spricht davon, den Fl√ºchtlingen die Staatsb√ºrgerschaft zu gew√§hren, was die meisten Probleme l√∂sen w√ºrde. Russland hat einen anderen Weg eingeschlagen: B√ºrger der Ukraine k√∂nnen in einem vereinfachten Verfahren einen russischen Pass erhalten.

Long-term economic benefits in form of arms industry expansion will be seen only in several years, geopolitical benefits in form of weaking Russia are not material, and influx of investments running away from Europe benefits Wall Street but not common Americans.

‚ûñContinued U.S. support of Ukraine is vital for the outcome of this conflict. Biden‚Äôs refusal to negotiate with Russia directly shows that his administration bets on continuation and escalation of war. Most military experts throughout the world agree that without U.S. support Ukraine will collapse in a matter of a month or two. The country is totally bankrupt and its military is totally dependent on Western supplies of weapons and ammunitions. 

üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è American people rightfully think that this conflict doesn‚Äôt concern them and are unhappy about huge volumes of aid to Ukraine while local economy is very close to recession that can potentially result in an economical crisis of the scale not yet seen this century. They rightfully think that government should show them real results instead of media stories about Ukrainian successes and Russian defeats. Especially when these stories aren‚Äôt based on any actual achievements. While many Americans still blindly believe the propaganda about Russian weakness and brag about their swift victories in Iraq, even those Americans still think that Russia and U.S need to talk and improve relations and that Ukraine is largely irrelevant for the U.S.

It will accuse Russia in use of nuclear weapons and will once again attempt to call its NATO friends into the conflict, escalating it to the level of global nuclear war. Anglo-Saxon media will scream all over the world about Russian crimes ignoring any common sense and internal Ukrainian propaganda will get yet another boost. Aside of that, using such a bomb in a city with potential sympathizers of Russia such as Nikolaev or Odessa makes some sense in context of terrorizing Ukrainian population so that they would not even think about shifting their loyalties. 

‚ûñ Ukraine is already known for numerous provocations in this conflict. It created a number of evidences of Russian ‚Äúatrocities‚Äù that turned out to be fakes or even crimes committed by Ukrainian military and paramilitary formations. Ukrainian point of view is promoted everywhere in globalist media while Russian point of view is ignored and silenced and even direct evidence debunking Ukrainian information is kept out of sight of the general public. 

‚ùì Will Ukraine do it with approval of the West? Independent journalists from the West covering the Ukrainian conflict think that this entire story is the initiative of the Ukrainian side and that military authorities of the US, UK and other NATO countries did not give approval for such a provocation and will specifically prohibit it after talks with Shoigu. Their objective is to keep the conflict restricted to Ukrainian territory and fight it to the last Ukrainian, they don‚Äôt want the conflict to spread and they don‚Äôt want to put their own countries at risk. 

‚ûñUnlike media and even Western government officials, Western military understands possible consequences very well and do not underestimate Russian capabilities in any way. They understand that nuclear provocation creates a very dangerous precedent and that possible Russian response may trigger the next World War. 

‚ùìCan Ukraine still do it without approval of the West? It is possible. Unlike Russia, Ukrainian leaders have nothing to lose and have already demonstrated their readiness to resort to any means to cause damage to Russia and their willingness to sacrifice their own citizens for this purpose.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,5365.0,17.0,2022-10-25T08:42:16+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,1943.0,69.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,375.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,375.0,,,,,MessageReplies,4.0,25478.0,False,[],,13295.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That created a very bad precedent and they just can‚Äôt be sure that such sanctions won‚Äôt be applied to them. For example, tomorrow US might ‚Äúnotice‚Äù that there is a war going on in Yemen, accuse Saudi Arabia of aggression and impose all imaginable sanctions against it. As for the issue of ‚Äúhuman rights‚Äù, no country can be safe from accusations here.

üî∑Now we come to WTO. In case with Russia, sanctions aren‚Äôt compliant with WTO rules or rather WTO objective to ‚Äúopen the markets and ensure stable, safe, transparent and predictable trade relations‚Äù.

üî∑Russia had strong opposition to WTO because its rules were detrimental for restoration of national industry and reduced its competitiveness on the global market. Yet, Russia still formally remains a WTO member althought it‚Äôs now a liability, not a benefit and it seems that WTO rules are ignored when applied to Russia.

üî∑This was true about all sanctions that were placed on Russia ever since December 2012 (and Russia entered WTO only in August 2012 after many years of negotiations and national legislation reforms).

üî∑Yes, article 21 of WTO charter provides WTO members the right to implement sanctions ‚Äúin the interests of national security‚Äù, but this article is too broad and doesn‚Äôt provide any specific scope of those ‚Äúinterests‚Äù. For example, it‚Äôs hard to see how any Russian actions in Europe impact US national security interests (in traditional sense). They could be perceived as impacting national security interests of EU countries, but it‚Äôs still too loose.
While it maybe can be applied to 2022 sanctions, it wasn‚Äôt applicable to 2012 sanctions, 2014 sanctions and all other sanction packages up to February 2022. 

üî∑To sum it up, yes, US can introduce any laws and try to enforce compliance with those laws. They will probably find a weak point and some OPEC members will back off and do whatever US says. However, this won‚Äôt make US actions legal. 

üî∑Yes, there are antitrust rules and laws, but they can be applied only in relevant jurisdictions.

‚òÖ‚Äî To begin with, the part of the world that does most for the Ukrainians is the Russian Federation. Besides fighting to save the ukrainians from the nationalist oppression, she is already spending more money on restoring housing and industrial facilities in the part of the Ukraine she is controlling ($52 billion) than any other country in the world has spent on sending means of destruction to the Kiev regime (the US has allotted $55 billion, the European Union $48 billion). The Kiev neo-Nazi regime, not the Ukrainians, is not at all supported by most of the world, neither whether you mean territory nor population. Or those that are governed by the governments of the Republic of India and the People's Republic of China have lately shrunk so dramatically to become less? (Not noting the American, Italian, Brazilian Venezuelan, Syrian and other volunteers who came to the Ukraine to fight against the neo-nazi unconstitutional regime of Kiev; neither noting the British, American, South African, French and other journalists who denounce the unconstitutional Kiev regime.) The question why is your ""most of the world"" took sides with what you call the Ukrainians is too easily answered: they did it long ago. Since the breakup of the Soviet Union in early in the 1990s, the West, determined to prevent Russia from becoming strong again, did what it could to foster anti-Russian sentiment and forces in the Ukraine.

Because Putin‚Äôs advances were not like he begged to take Russia in. He offered partnership. From Western point of view I see a number of possible problems:

1Ô∏è‚É£Firstly, Putin wanted Russia to play a role that would fit Russia as the largest country in the world with second strong military without consideration of Russian economy as evaluated by the West. Not just another NATO member, but an equal to the U.S.
The U.S. naturally did not want to concede any of its powers and did not want a potential challenger in its own military block.

2Ô∏è‚É£Secondly, terrorism was too small and insignificant target for the scale of NATO. Fighting terrorism is a task for Interpol. Using violent tactics to prevent terrorist attacks just creates more sources of terrorism. ISIS emerged as a natural consequences of invasion of Iraq.

NATO clearly understood it, so they needed an enemy to justify their existence. If an alliance does not have enemies, people may question its usefulness. Fortunately for the West, newly added NATO members from the Eastern Europe gave them an enemy.

Most post-communist states that entered NATO were ruled by nationalistic anti-communist elites and their agenda was heavily based on the idea of ‚ÄúSoviet occupation‚Äù. They saw (and see) Russia responsible for whatever USSR did, so anti-Russian sentiments became a noticeable part of their national ideologies.

I don‚Äôt know if they were serious when they were saying they are afraid of Russian invasion (they say it even now, but they also said it back in 1990s when Russia was in shambles).

Choosing Russia as the main enemy was reasonable because of numerous factors. First of all, this would solidify NATO membership of Eastern European countries. They wouldn‚Äôt challenge the U.S. and object against adding Russia to NATO if the U.S. chose this course. However, this would greatly reduce their enthusiasm about NATO and they would see no sense in staying.

Anyway, China was not yet a challenger to U.S. but still was economically stronger than Russia, so the U.S. saw it best to increase pressure on Russia, deprive Russia of all influence in neighboring countries and prevent all chances of Russian economical restoration back to USSR level and beyond it.

3Ô∏è‚É£Thirdly, there were technical difficulties. Reforming Russian army to NATO standards and NATO equipment would essentially be equivalent to reforming U.S. army to Soviet standards. A massive and pointless project. This means that NATO would have to adapt its standards for Russian arms and military specifics. As the result U.S. defense industry would see emerging competitor within their own military bloc, and that was unacceptable for the U.S.

4Ô∏è‚É£Fourthly, NATO with Russia would not have any challengers and this would make its existence pointless.

So, we see that NATO membership for Russia was indeed impossible. What about partnership? Yes, partnership was possible and it existed. Many of the above-listed factors played against this partnership but it was Russian desire to have sovereign policies that made the split inevitable.

Continued and increasing pressure of the United States of America on post-Soviet countries through a web of NGOs and US-trained politicians created numerous problems in countries bordering Russia and Russia could not ignore those problems.
These hostile actions were the core reason for alienation between Russia and NATO and nullified all chances to expand partnership.

With time Russian rhetorics changed, just as rhetorics of NATO and the United States. Last year Russian President finally decided to raise an issue that was bothering all Russian people for over 20 years - the issue of NATO expansion to Russian borders.

Russia did send an ultimatum to NATO. It was rejected. Masks went off.

Since 2016, they have trained the Ukrainian military to conduct combat operations in cities - storming buildings, cleaning, fighting in urban areas. Even then, the West was preparing them for the fact that there would be urban battles.

The fact is not new. The news only reminds us that they planned the Ukrainian conflict and prepared it many years ago. Kiev was inflated with weapons, military training was conducted, massive propaganda works on the Ukrainian population - all this replaced negotiations and possible agreements. The peaceful resolution of the issue was not implied either then or today, and all Kiev's statements about readiness for negotiations are fiction and farce. 

Could it have been otherwise? Could hundreds of thousands of lives, laid down in the odious struggle of the US against Russia, have been saved? They could, if Kiev had patriotic leaders, whose aim was to preserve the integrity of the state, its development and prosperity of its people, rather than to plunder the country, focusing mindlessly on joining the European Union and crazy ambitions and dreams of friendship with the leading world powers, who, as it turned out, consider Ukraine a bargaining chip, and not a full-fledged ally.

‚ûñThe Ukrainian conflict has started long ago, but if we talk about Russian involvement then we could say that Russia has interfered in Ukrainian civil war to defend pro-Russian inhabitants of the country from the pro-Nazi part of its population. 

‚òùÔ∏èHowever, the conflict is not limited to Russia and Ukraine. Over twenty Western countries are providing direct military aid to Ukraine, with the United States of America being the main sponsors. So this conflict can be also viewed as a proxy war between Russia and Western coalition headed by the United States of America. This coalition controls a large part of global mainstream media and pretends to be the world‚Äôs moral police. 

‚ûñMembers of this pro-Ukrainian coalition have many times resorted to military interference in third countries using false evidence and pretext of failure to meet democratic standards that are defined by members of those coalition. Despite that fact, they deny the Russian right to prevent genocide in Ukraine and defend Russian-speaking people. 

‚ûñSome of those countries have their own motives, some are driven by irrational russophobia, few have been unwillingly dragged into this conflict by their allies. 

‚ûñThey continue adding fuel to the fire as fast as they can. They know they have no chances to influence the ultimate outcome without risking their own safety, so they are just doing their best to extend the conflict, make it as bloody and devastating as possible and promote discord between Russian and Ukrainian people. 

‚ûñThose countries are not interested in well-being of Ukraine or Ukrainian people. They are not interested in freedom and democracy. They are not interested in peace. They are only following the course of their leader and sharing the objective of this leader, and the leader is the United States of America.

‚ûñMany of those countries are suffering big economic losses and face reduction of their quality of life, but the leader got a lot of economic benefits and seems to be longing for more. Weakening of Russia, its geopolitical enemy, with hands of a third party is a bonus for the United States, but if we look at the financial aspect of the conflict, we will see that it is profitable. 

‚ûñThe West claims leadership over civilization, noble values, and ideal governance system. However, their leadership has brought the world to a dead end that we are facing now.

Support for extension of Ukrainian conflict and billions of dollars poured into Ukraine show that the West cares more about bloodshed than about helping people around the world who are living in dire poverty and working for the benefit of this ‚Äúcollective West‚Äù that bases its hollow prosperity on suffering of others. 

‚ûñRussia challenged this leadership, Russia challenged the Western world order, Russia dared to defend its people and its values and now Russia became a primary target. However, Russia is not alone in its fight with the West. 

‚ûñAside for the Western coalition, most of the world remains neutral about the Ukrainian conflict itself and actually wants it to end in peace as soon as possible. As for the conflict of Russia with the collective West, a good part of global population cheers for Russia and wishes to break free of their chains placed by unipolar world.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,2971.0,9.0,,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,365.0,,,,,,,,MessageReplies,0.0,25478.0,False,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hopefully they aren‚Äôt. 

‚ûñHopefully, those Americans fully believe the picture presented by their mainstream media and think that Ukraine has no nazis (or rather ‚Äúevery country has some skinheads‚Äù), that Ukraine did not commit any atrocities in its civil war in Donbass and Russian intervention was not justified. 

‚ûñIf American people really knew how things were, if they were shown hundreds of factual materials, interviews with witnesses of those crimes, testimonies of captured Azov terrorists, they hopefully would not have any sympathies to this radical neo-Nazi group that was allowed to run loose, run autonomous military operations, terrorize civilian population, promote their ideology among children and do many other things that are absolutely against any human norms. 

‚ûñHopefully, people of America and Western Europe who are condemning Russia for its intervention simply don‚Äôt know the real situation, they don‚Äôt know what forces was Russia standing against. Had they really known, really seen that the Ukrainian government (at best) allowed neo-Nazis to run loose and left their crimes unpunished, that the Ukrainian government promoted radical nationalist ideology, that the Ukrainian government was really ready for genocide in Donbass, I think that they would change their mind. 

‚ûñIn fact, knowing that people in the U.S. and Western Europe do have strong sense of justice and endorse their governments to fight against oppressive governments turning against the people of their countries, if they really knew the real situation, they would request their leaders not just to stay neutral but to help Russia clean Ukraine of the poison of nazism. 
It is impossible to imagine that any reasonable and law-abiding person in the modern world who lives in a democratic and tolerant country could ever support the neo-Nazi groups and their apologists. Many people see the world as black and white and condemn Russia because of that, but it‚Äôs hard to imagine how could they see groups like Azov as ‚Äúwhite‚Äù. 

‚ûñUkrainian supporters keep saying that it‚Äôs absurd because Zelensky is Jewish and therefore there are no nazis in Ukraine. First of all, nazism is not equivalent to antisemitism. Nazism is about theories of superiority of a specific ethnic group over others. In this case, it manifests as radical Ukrainian nationalism that puts Ukraine above all and calls to eliminate the group that poses greatest danger for this radical nationalism ‚Äî Russian-speaking population of Ukraine. Zelensky‚Äôs government supported this ideas by enacting discriminative laws against use of Russian language. 

‚ûñIt‚Äôs worth noting that maybe Zelensky is not a follower of neo-Nazis and maybe he could even turned against them but they were too powerful for him to risk that. Maybe Zelensky was sincere in his electoral promises and really wanted to become the president of peace. However, harsh reality is that radical nationalists provided force support to 2014 Maidan in Ukraine and gained a lot of power and influence in the country since that time. Their positions were strong and Zelensky couldn‚Äôt do much about that even if he wanted. However, even firm condemnation of neo-Nazi activities by Zelensky would be enough and would probably prevent Russian intervention.

Message,12942,1639836943,2022-10-13T06:01:41+00:00,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"Hello. My name is Gleb Hevieu and I am a military correspondent, and I have been showing the world what is happening in the military conflict zone in Ukraine from day one.

While the world is watching massive Russian missile strikes on the territory of Ukraine, I am watching how these events are portrayed in the media.  Western media is shouting that Russia is a terrorist country.  In the countries of the middle East, Africa and Latin America, these events are characterized rather neutrally or even from a positive point of view - as actions that can bring the end of the war closer.

 To show what is really happening, I would like to refer to statistics of the victims from October 10, which were compiled by Forbes magazine, that can hardly be accused of sympathy for Russia.  The events of that day are shown as a terrorist attack and the costs of missiles are given: between 400 and 700 million dollars.  At the same time, the most interesting figure for us is the number of dead: 11 people.

  Let us closely examine the thought of the authors of these statistics: they believe that Russia committed a terrorist act costing at least $400 million and killed 11 people.  That's quite an expensive price, isn't it?

 Western media now likes to repeat that Russia was specifically waiting for civilians to walk the streets in order to kill as many people as possible, but does this look like a successful act of terror for at least $ 400 million?  Especially if we understand that Ukrainian air defenses cannot shoot down Russian ballistic missiles?  What really happened?

 We are in Donetsk, the city that 8 years ago rebelled against the Maidan, the coup d'√©tat in Kyiv, the city that refused to recognize the power of the Kyiv oligarchs who seized power as a result of those events.

 Western media are often confused in their evaluation of those events: at one time they say that separatists rule the city, at another time that the Russian army occupied it. But they prefer not to tell their audience that Ukrainian artillery shells have been flying here for 8 years now.

 We are located near a grocery store on Bakin Street, where on September 19 one of the shells transferred to Ukraine by NATO countries fell and killed 13 people at one moment.  One shell, not a rocket, killed 13 people.

 Here, on and around Universitetskaya Street, on March 14, a Ukrainian Tochka-U missile killed 21 civilians and wounded 31 more. Just one missile.  And these are just two cases in which I personally witnessed civilian casualties, and there were dozens of other bombings of Donetsk and other pro-Russian cities.

 So I am asking the question: do Western media really thinks their audience is that stupid?

 In reality, no one would spend at least $400 million to kill 11 civilians.  Ukraine copes with this task on a daily basis spending a very small amounts of money when it bombs our cities and villages.

 Russia is making very accurate strikes on military installations and infrastructure in Ukraine in order to quickly win and put an end to the bloodshed, in which only America is interested, having unleashed this war in its own geopolitical interests.

 Of course, despite the accuracy of the strikes, there will be occasional civilian casualties and we mourn this.  We are only consoled by the thought that the destruction of military objects in Ukraine will reduce the total number of victims of this war by hundreds of times.  And we are ready to spend a lot of money on it.

 Talking about Russian terrorism in the context of these infrastructure attacks is a stupid propaganda trick.  An attempt to portray us as animals, not people, an attempt to sow hatred and hide the real causes of the conflict.

‚ûñThe Ukrainian conflict has started long ago, but if we talk about Russian involvement then we could say that Russia has interfered in Ukrainian civil war to defend pro-Russian inhabitants of the country from the pro-Nazi part of its population. 

‚òùÔ∏èHowever, the conflict is not limited to Russia and Ukraine. Over twenty Western countries are providing direct military aid to Ukraine, with the United States of America being the main sponsors. So this conflict can be also viewed as a proxy war between Russia and Western coalition headed by the United States of America. This coalition controls a large part of global mainstream media and pretends to be the world‚Äôs moral police. 

‚ûñMembers of this pro-Ukrainian coalition have many times resorted to military interference in third countries using false evidence and pretext of failure to meet democratic standards that are defined by members of those coalition. Despite that fact, they deny the Russian right to prevent genocide in Ukraine and defend Russian-speaking people. 

‚ûñSome of those countries have their own motives, some are driven by irrational russophobia, few have been unwillingly dragged into this conflict by their allies. 

‚ûñThey continue adding fuel to the fire as fast as they can. They know they have no chances to influence the ultimate outcome without risking their own safety, so they are just doing their best to extend the conflict, make it as bloody and devastating as possible and promote discord between Russian and Ukrainian people. 

‚ûñThose countries are not interested in well-being of Ukraine or Ukrainian people. They are not interested in freedom and democracy. They are not interested in peace. They are only following the course of their leader and sharing the objective of this leader, and the leader is the United States of America.

‚ûñMany of those countries are suffering big economic losses and face reduction of their quality of life, but the leader got a lot of economic benefits and seems to be longing for more. Weakening of Russia, its geopolitical enemy, with hands of a third party is a bonus for the United States, but if we look at the financial aspect of the conflict, we will see that it is profitable. 

‚ûñThe West claims leadership over civilization, noble values, and ideal governance system. However, their leadership has brought the world to a dead end that we are facing now.

Support for extension of Ukrainian conflict and billions of dollars poured into Ukraine show that the West cares more about bloodshed than about helping people around the world who are living in dire poverty and working for the benefit of this ‚Äúcollective West‚Äù that bases its hollow prosperity on suffering of others. 

‚ûñRussia challenged this leadership, Russia challenged the Western world order, Russia dared to defend its people and its values and now Russia became a primary target. However, Russia is not alone in its fight with the West. 

‚ûñAside for the Western coalition, most of the world remains neutral about the Ukrainian conflict itself and actually wants it to end in peace as soon as possible. As for the conflict of Russia with the collective West, a good part of global population cheers for Russia and wishes to break free of their chains placed by unipolar world.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2971.0,9.0,2022-10-21T14:15:41+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,365.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,365.0,,,,,MessageReplies,4.0,25478.0,False,[],,11083.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hopefully they aren‚Äôt. 

‚ûñHopefully, those Americans fully believe the picture presented by their mainstream media and think that Ukraine has no nazis (or rather ‚Äúevery country has some skinheads‚Äù), that Ukraine did not commit any atrocities in its civil war in Donbass and Russian intervention was not justified. 

‚ûñIf American people really knew how things were, if they were shown hundreds of factual materials, interviews with witnesses of those crimes, testimonies of captured Azov terrorists, they hopefully would not have any sympathies to this radical neo-Nazi group that was allowed to run loose, run autonomous military operations, terrorize civilian population, promote their ideology among children and do many other things that are absolutely against any human norms. 

‚ûñHopefully, people of America and Western Europe who are condemning Russia for its intervention simply don‚Äôt know the real situation, they don‚Äôt know what forces was Russia standing against. Had they really known, really seen that the Ukrainian government (at best) allowed neo-Nazis to run loose and left their crimes unpunished, that the Ukrainian government promoted radical nationalist ideology, that the Ukrainian government was really ready for genocide in Donbass, I think that they would change their mind. 

‚ûñIn fact, knowing that people in the U.S. and Western Europe do have strong sense of justice and endorse their governments to fight against oppressive governments turning against the people of their countries, if they really knew the real situation, they would request their leaders not just to stay neutral but to help Russia clean Ukraine of the poison of nazism. 
It is impossible to imagine that any reasonable and law-abiding person in the modern world who lives in a democratic and tolerant country could ever support the neo-Nazi groups and their apologists. Many people see the world as black and white and condemn Russia because of that, but it‚Äôs hard to imagine how could they see groups like Azov as ‚Äúwhite‚Äù. 

‚ûñUkrainian supporters keep saying that it‚Äôs absurd because Zelensky is Jewish and therefore there are no nazis in Ukraine. First of all, nazism is not equivalent to antisemitism. Nazism is about theories of superiority of a specific ethnic group over others. In this case, it manifests as radical Ukrainian nationalism that puts Ukraine above all and calls to eliminate the group that poses greatest danger for this radical nationalism ‚Äî Russian-speaking population of Ukraine. Zelensky‚Äôs government supported this ideas by enacting discriminative laws against use of Russian language. 

‚ûñIt‚Äôs worth noting that maybe Zelensky is not a follower of neo-Nazis and maybe he could even turned against them but they were too powerful for him to risk that. Maybe Zelensky was sincere in his electoral promises and really wanted to become the president of peace. However, harsh reality is that radical nationalists provided force support to 2014 Maidan in Ukraine and gained a lot of power and influence in the country since that time. Their positions were strong and Zelensky couldn‚Äôt do much about that even if he wanted. However, even firm condemnation of neo-Nazi activities by Zelensky would be enough and would probably prevent Russian intervention.

For many years and even decades oil & gas export to the West has been one of the most important aspects for Russian budget. Russia received money and used this money to import many products and technologies from the Western countries, as well as for investment purposes. However, things have greatly changed ever since the West decided to economically isolate itself from Russia. 

Now, when Russia sells oil & gas to Western countries, it receives currency of those Western countries. Previously this currency stayed on foreign accounts and was used for the above purposes. Now these accounts are frozen and customers transfer it to Russian banks where it is exchanged for rubles. 

Now, there is a big question that has very simple answer. What is the difference between restricted emission of rubles and sale of resources to the West? The difference is that Russia keeps those resources and the West doesn‚Äôt get those resources.

Russia does not need any foreign currency because it has foreign trade proficit even without any export from the West. Remaining Russian gold and currency reserves are sufficient to balance the difference even if import volumes start increasing.

So, now only IMF rules prevent Russia from monetizing its economy, which has a chronic deficit of money for many years. 
However, if Russia decided to dump its dependence on US dollar, there is no need to stick to the rules established by US. Russia does not need dollars or euros as ‚Äúpaper‚Äù or ‚Äúdigits‚Äù. Russia needs imported products, services and technologies that can be bought with those dollars or euros or other currencies. 

Of course, even with independent currency emission excessive foreign trade profits can be used for investment outside the country. However, in present circumstances any foreign investments don‚Äôt look wise. The West constantly and desperately pressures third-world countries to cease their cooperation with Russia and only the strongest ones have the guts to remain neutral. 

üîπRussian land has all necessary resources to sustain four times its current population. Rebuilding industry will take time, but it will be worth the effort. Russia will not perish, the only loss here will be the loss of extra profits for stakeholders of oil &gas companies. I wouldn‚Äôt be so sure about Russian customers in the West.

Of course, there are other aspects that are important in the issue of energy supplies. In rational world energy deal between two entities would mean that they would both seek to maintain as friendly relations as possible and avoid any actions against the other side. The customer fully dependent on supplies should not bite the supplier. However, actions of the collective Europe show that we no longer live in a rational world. Why bother then? 

Finally, the West is not the whole world. Exporting valuable natural resources in exchange for import of consumer goods and technologies sounds much more reasonable than selling them to enemies for money that have little real value.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2729.0,5.0,2022-10-20T15:52:19+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,80.0,MessageEntityBold,351.0,111.0,MessageEntityBold,822.0,96.0,MessageEntityBold,1381.0,184.0,MessageEntityBold,2671.0,70.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,362.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,362.0,,,,,MessageReplies,6.0,25478.0,False,[],,11043.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Message,10857,1639836943,2022-10-19T16:09:27+00:00,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"¬´How can someone trust Russian media if all independent media in Russia are banned?¬ª

‚Äî It is not a simple question. First of all, not all independent media in Russia are banned. Not all of them violate Russian laws that restrict attempts to discredit the special operation in Ukraine, the Russian government and the Russian Armed Forces. 

‚ùîHowever, should one trust mainstream Western media over Russian media? It is a big question. The problem with mainstream Western media is that they strongly stand on Ukrainian side and promote solely Ukrainian version of events. They cheer and exaggerate even the smallest Ukrainian successes and ignore even the most obvious facts that confirm Russian point of view. 

The industry of fakes is another noticeable difference. Ukrainian president has a background in TV show industry and he probably brought a good part of his former team to work on filming shows and videos that would bring him the greatest support of the West. All these fakes are well known and debunked by the Russian side with factual proof. However, the Western media did not debunk those fakes and their audience still believes it was real. 

It is impossible to trust sources that completely distort facts. Russian media outlets don‚Äôt present critical opinions about the special operation in Ukraine, but at least they don‚Äôt distort reality. 

Let‚Äôs give an example: 

Western media says: Russia is losing war, hundreds of thousands Russian soldiers are dead, Russian tanks are all broken and abandoned, Putin‚Äôs regime is crumbling, Russia is bringing untrained conscripts with WW1 rifles to the fronts as cannon fodder;

Russian media says: Russian army has completed tactical retreat from Kharkov region and fell back to prepared defense positions in Kherson region, at the same time it is slowly advancing in Artemovsk, the number of permanent casualties is 5.937, Ukraine depends on Western supplies of arms, Zelensky‚Äôs regime stubbornly refuses negotiations

Note that the West is operating vague and overly exaggerated statements, while Russia is providing specific numbers and facts that are logically reasonable and can be verified.

‚è∫Western media says: Putin threatens the world with nuclear weapons

‚è∫Russian media says: Putin welcomed new territories into Russia and confirmed willingness to defend them at all costs.

Since transcripts of Putin‚Äôs speech are available, it‚Äôs easy to look what he said and who is lying.

Russia does not try to create a fake picture of victories, it prefers real thing to virtual victories. Of course, not everything is so simply and not all Western media are completely biased. However, even media of neutral countries don‚Äôt see the Ukrainian conflict properly because they view not as an invasion and not as liberation but as a proxy war between Russia and the West.

As for banning ‚Äúindependent media‚Äù, there is one factor to consider. Moral condemnation is good and all, but if your country is fighting, you have to support it, not condemn it. Anything else is just treason. It could be disguised under moral values but it‚Äôs still treason. 

Right or wrong, doesn‚Äôt matter. Time for judgment and evaluation will come later, time to punish may come later. Calling for peace is great, calling for surrender and defeat of your country is betrayal. Of course, some may not see the difference.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,10499.0,54.0,2022-10-20T15:09:00+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,86.0,MessageEntityBold,341.0,1.0,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,341.0,1.0,MessageEntityBold,342.0,71.0,MessageEntityItalic,712.0,55.0,MessageEntityBold,1360.0,25.0,MessageEntityUnderline,1360.0,25.0,MessageEntityBold,2158.0,1.0,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,2158.0,1.0,MessageEntityBold,2159.0,20.0,MessageEntityBold,2227.0,1.0,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,2227.0,1.0,MessageEntityBold,2228.0,20.0,MessageEntityBold,3137.0,81.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,359.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,359.0,,,,,MessageReplies,29.0,25478.0,False,[],,14850.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

‚Äî Russia will definitely learn its lessons from it and many lessons have already been learned. One of the most important lessons is about PR support. As it turned out, PR is essential element of swift success and broad support of any actions by international community. We really should have brought a vial of detergent to UN General Assembly as an excuse. 

In Russian-speaking world Russian actions are explained and covered adequately, but this is not the case in English-speaking world, especially when few English-language media from Russia have been banned and denied access to the most popular platforms in the Western world. We could hope that Western people would see the truth and real reasoning for the Russian operation, but they simply fell for everything that globalist media told them. 

Most people in the West are simply not interested in this story. They hear some noise about Russian attack on Ukraine and they don‚Äôt care about researching the background of the story. However, it means that they accept media narrative and don‚Äôt challenge the ‚Äúpublic opinion‚Äù.

üì¢ That said, Russian leadership could also learn a lesson from this unprecedented but not unexpected media attack and pay more attention to global PR aspect in future. They think that ‚Äúactions speak better than words‚Äù but forget that words may present those actions in very different light. Words are very important in modern world, as are those who control those words. 

Would ‚Äúfriends of Ukraine‚Äù be so determined to help Ukraine if this intervention was done by U.S. on the same excuses as Russia did? You know, end bloodshed, eliminate Nazi ideology, demilitarize belligerent state Doesn‚Äôt it sound a bit like the grounds for invasion of Iraq? Just put ‚ÄúBaasist‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúNazi‚Äù and that‚Äôs it. 

Would Europe be so determined to help Ukraine if global media focused on Ukrainian atrocities, murder of journalists, calls for genocide, prohibition of opposition parties, unprecedented corruption and other ‚Äúachievements of Ukrainian democracy‚Äù?

It‚Äôs all about information background and it looks like global media indeed have global influence. The question is, who defines the agenda for these media?

Will Russia learn the lesson? Covering actions with nice words is against Russian cultural traditions, but the world changes, so maybe. Hopefully, in future we will have a better world where Russia will not be forced to make such choices.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2680.0,6.0,2022-10-19T06:56:31+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,46.0,MessageEntityBold,142.0,55.0,MessageEntityBold,1036.0,92.0,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,1130.0,2.0,MessageEntityBold,1504.0,133.0,MessageEntityUnderline,2082.0,99.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,358.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,358.0,,,,,MessageReplies,18.0,25478.0,False,[],,14806.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

‚Äî Objecting Russian actions, disapproval and especially criticizing is not playing against Russia, in fact it is good, especially if done openly. Public discussions of problems on international forums and as a part of diplomatic interaction are beneficial, they can be an excellent way to see the problems we don‚Äôt see and work on there solution.

However, there are many flaws in actions and words we see and hear from the Western society. There is a problem of double standards. In absolutely identical situations Russia is criticized for aggressive and malicious actions, while the West is praised for peacekeeping and promotion of democracy. If NATO takes or even just favors one side of the conflict, this side is declared an embodiment of all possible virtues.

In 2008 Russia was presented as aggressor in Georgian conflict despite acting on defensive side. In 2011 NATO intervention in Lybia was presented as a glorious mission to overthrow a brutal dictator. In Syria the West tried to do the same on the grounds of outrageous provocations that were claimed to be ‚Äúuse of chemical weapons by the government‚Äù and confirmed by semi-virtual organization of ‚ÄúWhite Helmets‚Äù that had links with British intelligence service, at least through their former officers.

And what about numerous accusations of Russian president in murder of his political opponents? BBC, CNN and other Western media talked about it as proven fact. 

Case of Sergey Magnitsky, while sad, was used as a pretext to implement sanctions against Russia. A whole country, all of us. Without any proof or investigation, just on the basis of claims. Yes, a man died in prison. But was there any good reason to punish 145 million people for that? How many people die in prisons everywhere in the world, including Western countries? How many of them are political opponents of their governments?

üî∫The West always says Russia must ‚Äúplay by the rules‚Äù but it violates the rules when it sees fit. For example, sanctions against Russia contradict WTO rules and Russia is a WTO member, so they are illegal from the very beginning and even if Russia leaves WTO they will remain illegal because the law has no retroactive effect. 

The West always speaks about legitimacy, democracy and laws but it supported illegal revolt in Kiev in 2014 that resulted in overthrow of democratically elected president who didn‚Äôt even finish his term. At the same time they did not acknowledge perfectly legitimate actions of Ukrainian regions that did not want to be subjugated by those ‚Äúrebels‚Äù. 

So no, Russia has nothing against disapproval and critics. However, actions and provocations are a different thing.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2726.0,9.0,2022-10-18T07:14:19+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,181.0,MessageEntityBold,663.0,165.0,MessageEntityBold,1151.0,300.0,MessageEntityBold,1712.0,28.0,MessageEntityBold,2584.0,146.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,355.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,355.0,,,,,MessageReplies,5.0,25478.0,False,[],,10750.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That is unlikely and it‚Äôs a pity. There is a chance that by 2024 Putin will nominate a successor and will not run for another six-year term. Considering political situation in Russia it is unlikely that any other party will nominate a candidate popular enough to win over United Russia, even communists. By the way, Communist Party of the Russian Federation is a very real and most popular opposition party in Russia, although the West tries to present some street populists with criminal background as top opposition leaders.

‚è∫As for chances for reconciliation in 2024 and beyond, it will solely depend on actions of the West and on the outcome of Ukrainian crisis. If the crisis will not be resolved, Putin may run for another term himself or choose a successor who will be more hawkish and more focused on foreign policy and military (for example, Dmitry Medvedev). If the crisis will be over, it would be more reasonable to nominate someone focused on internal development and economics (like Mishustin). 

War on the battlefields and economical war require two different approaches, but both are still wars. Is there a chance to stop it? Of course. However, going easier should involve a lot and should be unconditional. 

In fact, friendly attitude to Russia has been, is and will be the best way to ensure lasting peace. For starters, maybe it was not a good idea to finance NGOs in Russia that tried to promote American agenda? Maybe it was not a good idea to accuse Russia and Russian leader of crimes basing on wishful thinking and not on solid proof? Maybe it was not a good idea to instigate riots in Ukraine, which is the most important country for Russia? Maybe even keeping Cold War policies after USSR dissolution was not that smart?

The best and easiest way to achieve global peace would be to leave Russia alone, trade with it and acknowledge its interests. It doesn‚Äôt matter who the president is. 

Would the Western countries go easier on Russia? I don‚Äôt think so, unless we really get a deal about ‚ÄúNew World Order‚Äù that will acknowledge interests of Russia, China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Iran, Egypt, Nigeria and many other regional powers that are continuously pressured and strangled by the Western bloc in an attempt to prevent emergence of competitors. We need a deal about multipolar world. We need regional powers with regional integration blocs and that we need to create economical ties betwen those powers to get lasting peace between them and move a step ahead to planetary integration. Economical domination of the West should be a thing of the past. Democracy comes with prosperity, not vice versa. First you need to satisfy the basic needs and then you can wait for something else. Creating an ‚Äúisland of prosperity‚Äù that will thrive at the expense of the rest of the world is a dead end and a perfect recipe for endless conflicts.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2721.0,6.0,2022-10-17T11:29:57+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,120.0,MessageEntityBold,538.0,110.0,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,648.0,1.0,MessageEntityUnderline,824.0,134.0,MessageEntityBold,1234.0,40.0,MessageEntityBold,1872.0,168.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,354.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,354.0,,,,,MessageReplies,9.0,25478.0,False,[],,10751.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How can we accept this fatal blow to post-WW2 world order where all nations agreed not to move their borders by force, which would be the precedent for future land-grabs?¬ª

‚Äî Not really. Russia isn‚Äôt ‚Äúgrabbing land‚Äù sticks to the principles of self-determination. 

‚ùóÔ∏èIt wasn‚Äôt planned to organize recent referendums in the middle of fighting, but they were needed to assure local people that Russia will not abandon them. In fact, initial Russian terms didn‚Äôt include any ‚Äúland grabs‚Äù. 

Giving Russian land to Ukraine was ‚Äúfine‚Äù for everyone. Even Russia accepted it as long as Ukraine stayed friendly.

The whole thing started with Ukraine refusing to give autonomy to its regions as it agreed and using military force to bring them to toe. This is not a behavior that should be endorsed for a European country. Decisive European response to those actions would prevent all this. Even the lightest sanctions against Ukraine could prevent it all. Even official condemnation could prevent it all.

Now we have open military conflict but everyone presents the Russian side as aggressor. But it‚Äôs not so simple. Maybe Putin has just decided not to tolerate slow increase of sanction pressure, endless provocations and Donbass people dying every day and just cut the Gordian knot of East Ukraine once and for all.

Russia couldn‚Äôt abandon East Ukraine and it‚Äôs not about land grabs but about lives of people. Russian response probably also ruined lives, but the other side had a choice to prevent it, the most obvious and reasonable choice that coudl result in lasting peace and remove this ‚Äúhot spot‚Äù from the map ending the conflict forever. 

Yes, it would be a loss for Ukraine and the West. But it wouldn‚Äôt change the world order. The world is dynamic, new countries keep appearing on the map. Using force to prevent it is the same aggression, just seen from a different angle.

Rebel forces did try to negotiate. Germany, France and Russia helped to forge a win-win agreement between rebels and Ukraine that could end the conflict without dissolution of Ukrainian state. 

Ukraine accepted it but didn‚Äôt even start its implementation despite numerous promises to do so, with the most loud promises coming from present Ukrainian president who got into power solely because of those promises and desire of Ukrainians for peace.

‚Äî Let‚Äôs leave aside the factor of Nazi terror in Ukraine. So they would have a choice between having no representation in their own country and being forced to abandon their own language and culture or leaving, right? 

Ukraine was created on the grounds of equal rights for Russian-speaking population, that was the promise of the first Ukrainian president, the cornerstone of Ukrainian independence, the only reason why Russia and Russian-speaking population accepted it and didn‚Äôt dispute it even when Russia rose from ashes. 

‚ùóÔ∏èMillions of Ukrainians, not just in Donbass, were not happy about language laws, prohibition of Russian culture and alterations of history. Parties that represented their views were disbanded and declared illegal. Like the Party of Regions, a party that represented East and South Ukraine and was deprived of their victory in presidential elections by rioters from other regions. 

Russia did expect that those forces will return to power or at least will get serious representation in government and will peacefully solve the crisis and repeal discriminative laws. Instead, Ukraine got Zelensky who promised national reconciliation and peace but did absolutely the opposite. 

Disbanding opposition parties representing many millions of people, terrorizing and persecuting opponents, killing journalists. With support of well fed capital and backing of semi-legal paramilitary formations that terrorized the country Zelensky could not fear anything except rebellion in other regions and he made sure that those regions are kept in toe by appointing local governors and backing them with force. 

There were no chances for removal of Zelensky through traditional Ukrainian means of street riots because he made it impossible. There were no chances for his impeachment because he disbanded the strongest opposition and terrorized the rest to get the puppet parliament. 

Russia could wait for a few more years and hope that Zelensky‚Äôs successor will show more reason and integrity. His own popularity was below the floor and he had no chances for a second term in democratic elections. 

However, there was no guarantee of democratic elections, there was no guarantee that Zelensky won‚Äôt be replaced by a similar populist who will forget about all promises right after inauguration and there was no guarantee that Zelensky won‚Äôt apply to further escalation and start a massive attack in Donbass blaming Russia of everything to create the image of national hero that he enjoys now. 
Most importantly, waiting would mean more deaths in Donbass.

Children continue to be killed, wounded and deeply traumatized by the violence all around them. Many have seen things no child should ever see. Their homes have been hit. Their schools have been attacked, along with all the systems that could help them survive. Families are terrified, in shock, and desperate for safety.

üî∫First of all, Russia does not want to ‚Äúannex‚Äù the entire Ukraine. It will welcome those regions that will voluntarily choose return to the Russian world and will not force those who are not willing to do it. 

Ukrainian people are very diverse and have a lot of different opinions. Ukrainian government has strongly promoted anti-Russian ideology for many years since 2014 using both legal means and semi-legal forces of radicals (Nazis) that terrorized everyone who disagreed with the ‚Äúofficial position‚Äù. Ukrainian terror in Donbass and failure of the government to persecute Nazis for crimes such as massacre in the House of Unions in Odessa have shown the people that it is not safe to express any good feelings about Russia. 

üì¢ ‚ÄúOnly those who hate Russia are proclaimed ‚Äútrue patriots of Ukraine‚Äù. Moreover, as we understand, it will be the main national idea for further development of Ukrainian statehood. Hate and animosity form a weak foundation for national sovereignty with many serious risks and grave consequences, and history has proven it many times‚Äù. ‚Äì V. Putin, ‚ÄúOn historical unity of Russians and Ukrainians‚Äù, 2021.

Pro-Russian Ukrainians learned to hide their feelings long before this conflict started and now, in the environment of total terror and martial law when they literally risk life for saying anything positive about Russia and Russians, it is impossible to get an objective assessment of their numbers and their feelings about Russia. 

It is clear that some Ukrainians are extremely nationalistic and believe the hate promoted by the Ukrainian government. Some just pretend to have such views to avoid persecution. Most are just silent and we can‚Äôt read their hearts. However, virtually all Ukrainians were subjected to heavy anti-Russian propaganda ever since the coup in 2014, which ended hopes for peaceful and democratic Ukraine. 

‚ùî What do Ukrainians think about becoming a part of Russia? Only time and actual votes can tell. Many of previously pro-Russian Ukrainians are now angry, especially in East and South Ukraine, the former lands of Novorossiya. 

Some didn‚Äôt expect military interference of Russia, they just wanted to keep living their lives pretending to ignore the ghost of Nazism in Kiev while it didn‚Äôt loom over them. Some of them wanted to be with Russia, expected Russian aid but now they think that Russia came too late. It‚Äôs hard to blame them, but Russia indeed tried to end this conflict without violence for many years and we can‚Äôt say that it wasn‚Äôt worth trying to achieve this. 

Some previously pro-Russian Ukrainians have turned against Russia. Especially those who have already lost something or someone dear in this conflict. It‚Äôs understandable, but even these people are already seeing the truth and secretly blame the government for their stubborn desire to fight to the last Ukrainian in the attempt to hold lands that don‚Äôt want to be ruled by this government. 

Still, there are some Ukrainians who secretly dream of return to the Russian world. They are silent, they are hiding their dreams to save their lives, but they do exist. 

There is still a chance that Ukrainian people will own their eyes and see that their main enemies are sitting in Kiev and Washington, not in Moscow. Maybe they still have a chance to end the fratricidal conflict and open a way for lasting peace and reconciliation.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2777.0,6.0,2022-10-14T12:17:00+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,91.0,MessageEntityBold,379.0,80.0,MessageEntityItalic,829.0,2.0,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,829.0,2.0,MessageEntityItalic,831.0,405.0,MessageEntityBold,1469.0,101.0,MessageEntityUnderline,1802.0,168.0,MessageEntityBold,1970.0,1.0,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,1970.0,1.0,MessageEntityBold,1971.0,58.0,MessageEntityBold,2197.0,178.0,MessageEntityItalic,3121.0,89.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,346.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,346.0,,,,,MessageReplies,5.0,25478.0,False,[],,10454.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently FSB has arrested a Ukrainian saboteur in Moscow region. He possessed two ‚ÄúIgla‚Äù MANPADs and it is likely that he was planning a terrorist attack on civilian airplane or aircraft used for training young pilots.

Ukrainians and their Western sponsors would surely cheer him and call him a great hero if he succeeded with his plans. Anyway, how is this relevant to the question?

The thing is, weapons supplied to Ukraine are not tightly controlled with possible exception of some high-grade items such as HIMARS. Nobody is checking how many Javelins are there and whether they are lost in combat, exploded or simply sold away.

For many months it is possible to buy virtually any weapons supplied to Ukraine en masse on the black market and according to reports it‚Äôs still possible today. Darknet offers a plenty of opportunities and Ukrainians have been known for their successes on black market of weapons ever since collapse of USSR. Prices are quite low and diversity of offers is impressive.

According to anonymous reports of Ukrainian servicemen, illegal weapon trade is flourishing on all levels, from sergeants to generals. It‚Äôs not just Western-supplied weapons, it‚Äôs everything. It is really very easy to write-off weapons as used, lost or destroyed in battle or combat operation, nobody is able to check this.

üî∫The West has supplied Ukraine with weapons worth close to 100 billion USD. Considering the level of corruption in Ukraine, it is quite easy to imagine that at least some Ukrainians couldn‚Äôt resist the temptation to gain some material benefit from the conflict.

‚ÅâÔ∏èWhere do these weapons go? Some are purchased by European and international criminal gangs as it‚Äôs a rare opportunity to expand their arsenals. Some are purchased‚Ä¶ by Russians. This applies only to latest equipment. Russian intelligence services still claim that they managed to purchase HIMARS for about $900k a couple months ago.

However, most of the weapons go to ‚Äúhot spots‚Äù all around the world. Weapons from Ukraine were seen in Kosovo and Bosnia, in the Middle East, in Africa.

Interestingly, there was even a case with one NLAW unit being sold in Alaska.

Are there any risks to countries that supply those weapons? Not for the United States. As for Europeans, they don‚Äôt see those risks as well as potential future risks. They don‚Äôt understand that a large part of these weapons will end in Europe. If not now, then when the conflict is over or when Ukrainian army will feel imminent defeat. Moreover, when the conflict is over, criminal underworld of Europe may see serious changes with hundreds thousands of Ukrainians with military experience and weapons willing to ‚Äúreunite with their families‚Äù.

Even if Ukraine wins by some miracle, there will be people who would prefer ‚Äúeasy money‚Äù and ‚Äúbeautiful life‚Äù in Europe to hard mundane work at home. Such things often happen after wars. Many Vietnam and Iraq veterans in U.S., many Afghanistan and Chechnya veterans in Russia couldn‚Äôt find themselves a place in civilian life. With seemingly rich, prosperous and weak Europe just around the corner it won‚Äôt be hard for Ukrainian veterans to win a place in European underworld.

And crime is not the only risk. How about terrorism? 

‚ÅâÔ∏èWhat if next time a terrorist with MANPAD will appear not near Moscow but somewhere around Berlin, Paris or London?

Business tycoons also get their share for their private armies, but that is the last thing Europe should worry about, these weapons will be used to divide power after the conflict is over.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2795.0,5.0,2022-10-13T17:54:35+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,141.0,MessageEntityBold,527.0,133.0,MessageEntityUnderline,937.0,148.0,MessageEntityBold,1473.0,75.0,MessageEntityBold,1737.0,27.0,MessageEntityUnderline,2139.0,83.0,MessageEntityBold,2363.0,107.0,MessageEntityBold,3384.0,115.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,345.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,345.0,,,,,MessageReplies,2.0,25478.0,False,[],,10247.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

‚Äî Because Russia will attack back. The thing is that Russian people have no grudge against American people. They don‚Äôt want you dead. They just want to be left alone and wanted so for many decades. Russia already had a puppet US government in 1991‚Äì1999 and it didn‚Äôt end well. 

The U.S. always had an option to prevent this war. The U.S. always has an option to come on terms with Russia. We are not in war even now although you interfered in our business. Remember that story a couple years when there was a rumor about Russians supplying weapons to Taliban? Headlines were full of righteous rage against us and calls to put us in toe. 

And you are openly supplying weapons to our enemy to kill our soldiers and extend this war instead of ending it. 

Yes, you may think that Russia is wrong, maybe we indeed made some mistakes but it‚Äôs not as simple as ‚Äúunprovoked invasion‚Äù. I won‚Äôt get deep into it as it‚Äôs irrelevant to the question. Anyway, it‚Äôs our business. 

The United States can end it at any moment if they want to. Not by force, we don‚Äôt need war. 

‚ùî But what about diplomacy? Our leaders talked and negotiated back in Cold War times when we were real ideological enemies, when USSR really wanted to spread communism to US and change your way of life. 

Why can‚Äôt they talk and negotiate now, when both our countries are no longer ideological enemies and have nothing to share? Why don‚Äôt you just halt your puppets and try to come to terms with Russians, so all of us could return to our peaceful life and don‚Äôt worry about anything.

What's the best way to end this conflict (no propaganda please)?¬ª

‚Äî No propaganda? Ok, not a single word about reasons for this conflict or it being right or wrong, just a view of the current situation. From Russia.
If Ukraine agreed to negotiations, there would be no problem to find some grounds to move on. For example, several high-ranked Russian officials mentioned that Elon Musk‚Äôs proposal is somewhat reasonable and coult be considered if it came from official source. 

Even previous negotiations in March when the sides have almost agreed to freeze the issue of recognizing contested territories for 20‚Äì30 years could be used as a starting point (with Kherson and Zaporozhye regions added to the list of those territories, which wasn‚Äôt the case in March).

Russia is ready to negotiate but it isn‚Äôt ready to surrender. Ukraine isn‚Äôt ready to negotiate and is expecting Russian surrender. This means we are stuck.

This would surely be very unpopular in the West, but only some massive Russian victories or successes can bring peace. 

ü§î Why?

Complete Russian defeat is virtually impossible. With Western aid Ukraine can maintain status quo and even make some slow advances if Russia keeps its current level of commitment to the special operation and doesn‚Äôt use more decisive measures such as recent massive missile strike on infrastructure. Escalation of the conflict and Ukrainian successes don‚Äôt demoralize most Russian people but increase their motivation. 

Although Ukrainian army currently has serious numeric advantage over the Russian army (about 5:1), they didn‚Äôt manage even to push Russians back to pre-February positions. There were no decisive battles, no defeats. And well, without direct interference of NATO soldiers Russia greatly outnumbers Ukraine. Direct interference of NATO will result in world war. Not many options.
Yes, Western media focuses on Ukrainian successes, even minor ones and this creates a false impression that the Ukrainian side is winning. 

Support of most popular global media is indeed a powerful tool. Even what you see as ‚Äúfacts‚Äù should be doubted. They are calling Russian reservists ‚Äúcannon fodder armed with rusty WW1 rifles‚Äù. They are talking about immense Russian casualties, even higher than in first months of WW2 when German forces swept over Western USSR and were close to capturing Moscow. I leave you to think on credibility of this.

It is important because it creates an impression that complete Ukrainian victory is possible. It is not. Ukraine has stopped Russian offensive and this should be the best time for them to enter negotiations.

Maybe some wishful thinkers expect rebellion in Russia, but judging by the moods of people it won‚Äôt be happening in any foreseeable future. Russian people are not stupid and will not repeat 1917. Even if they don‚Äôt like something, they will deal with it when everything is over. Not now.

üî∫Complete Ukrainian defeat is also unlikely. Russia can achieve it quickly only using methods that will bring suffering to civilian population. Russia still views Ukrainian civilians as stray sheep and hopes that their eyes will open and that will bring chances for reconciliation. Anyway, continued Western weapon supplies will make it last for a very long tie unless Russia greatly increases its committment to the operation.

The situation is indeed very complicated. Something has to be done to convince Ukraine to resume peace talks. It‚Äôs worth noting that successful peace talks in April would save thousands lives and would cost Ukraine much less than what is proposed now.

How can Ukraine be brought to its senses? Well, if the West really wants peace, maybe they should stop supplying weapons to conflict zone and send their demands not to Russia but to the other side?",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2697.0,6.0,2022-10-12T18:34:17+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,226.0,MessageEntityBold,990.0,93.0,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,1206.0,2.0,MessageEntityBold,1808.0,44.0,MessageEntityBold,2267.0,81.0,MessageEntityBold,2564.0,207.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,341.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,341.0,,,,,MessageReplies,18.0,25478.0,False,[],,10496.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Message,10130,1639836943,2022-10-12T13:13:06+00:00,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"¬´Why do Russians keep accusing so many countries of Russophobia? Don't they understand that these countries have a good reason to be afraid of them and distrust their intentions?¬ª

‚Äî No, Russians don‚Äôt understand it. If Russia will declare a new ideology and will promise to spread it all over the world, there will be a reason to be afraid. If Russia officially proclaims that it wishes to return all its former lands, there will be a reason to be afraid. This is not the case.
¬†
In post-Soviet period Russia has shown that its friends have absolutely nothing to fear. NATO is not the only way to defend from Russia, being on friendly terms works as well.
¬†
Russians accuse so many countries of Russophobia because Russian media publishes quotes of the most russophobic media articles and statements of politicians. Not so many Russians travel abroad and they naturally think that if some prominent Polish politician is russophobic, every Pole is a russophobe. 

This has created a lot of distrust between Russia and its former allies, especially since virtually all of those allies suddenly became members of EU (economical competitor) and NATO (hostile military bloc).
¬†
The other issue is that russophobia became a national idea in many post-Soviet countries. New elites wanted to strengthen their power and blaming Russians for all bad things is a good foundation for local nationalism. Besides, the West likes russophobes. If a country like Estonia suddenly decided to become a friend of Russia, it could easily lose some of its EU subsidies. Moreover, it would lose its image and could be even kicked from EU and NATO, its leader proclaimed a dictator, etc. etc. etc.
¬†
Russophobia will exist as long as Russia will be weaker than its enemies and as long as it will have this enemies. That is the reason for continuous attempts to make look Russia even weaker than it is and prevent development of real Russian potential.
¬†
See what happened in Ukraine in 2013‚Äì2014. Russia made a lucrative offer to Ukraine about joining the Eurasian Union. Numerous trade benefits, immediate membership, low-interest loans, status of an equal partner. Ukrainian president was choosing between this offer and remote prospects of association with EU that would require a lot of reforms and a lot of time, while it wouldn‚Äôt bring the same economical benefits. 

Ukrainian president announced that he doesn‚Äôt like the current program of EU association and this was the end of him. He was overthrown and the West cheered it. Had he made a different decision, not the one that he considered best for the country, the West would cheer him even if he drowned Ukraine in blood. In fact they did cheer his successor who made ‚ÄúWestern choice‚Äù and did exactly that - drowned Ukraine in blood.
¬†
Ukraine in Eurasian Union would make it a strong emerging competitor to economical dominance of the West. Rich natural resources, land corridor from China to Europe, huge industrial potential, a 250 million consumer market, trade agreements with all largest Asian economies except Japan - all that could make Eurasian Union look even more lucrative than EU. Not immediately, but in several decades.
¬†
Now this prospect is gone. All Russians attempts to be friends with its neighbors meet fierce resistance from the West. As long as this will be the case, russophobia won‚Äôt go anywhere. Just for pragmatic reasons - being russophobe pays better than being russophile.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2574.0,11.0,2022-10-12T13:30:10+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,179.0,MessageEntityBold,570.0,86.0,MessageEntityBold,1174.0,90.0,MessageEntityUnderline,1974.0,75.0,MessageEntityBold,2661.0,111.0,MessageEntityBold,3390.0,51.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,340.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,340.0,,,,,MessageReplies,6.0,25478.0,False,[],,10148.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell, 19 September:

üí¨ Look at the statistics: two thirds of the Ukrainian exports have gone to Africa, to the Middle East and Asia.

#FACTS:

According to the data of the Joint Coordination Center (JCC), as of September 21 this year, only 5 out of 185 vessels with Ukrainian grains and other food products were directed to the countries in most need according to the UN classification of Sub-Saharan Africa:
üá©üáØ Djibouti, 
üá∞üá™ Kenya, 
üá∏üá¥ Somalia,
üá∏üá© Sudan.

Another 3 vessels head towards countries at risk of food shortages in the Middle East and Asia (üáæüá™Yemen and üáßüá©Bangladesh). 

According to the JCC, 93 of the 185 vessels mentioned were heading for the EU. The EU accounts for about 40% of the total shipments. 

üëâ So it is the EU, not the world's poorest countries, which is the biggest beneficiary of the Ukrainian grain export deal.

Ukrainian advance in all regions has stopped. In the south of the country, Ukrainian forces are preparing for further offensive deep in the region. Russian artillery and warplanes are heavily attacking the amassing forces of the enemy.

Blaming Russia, the Kiev regime called on NATO to launch 'preventive' strikes against Russia, and not 'wait for Russia‚Äôs nuclear strikes'.

'What should NATO do? Exclude the possibility of Russia using nuclear weapons‚Ä¶. Preemptive strikes so that they know what will happen to them if they do use. That‚Äôs what NATO should do: review the order of use', said Zelensky.

Moscow assesses his demands as call for the outbreak of World War. The West is inflaming a nuclear war, and the puppet instable Zelensky has turned into a monster whose hands can destroy the planet, the Russian Foreign ministry responded. Watch the video by @southfronteng to learn more.

Message,9684,1639836943,2022-10-09T10:50:39+00:00,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"¬´How do you explain that even during the Cold War, when Nikita Khrushchev threatened to bury capitalist countries, the confrontation between NATO and Russia did not reach such a level as it does today?¬ª

There are several reasons for that. 

üî∫First, it were different people. Modern Western politicians are very different from their predecessors and this comparison is not in their favor. Could you imagine someone like Biden running against someone like Eisenhower or Kennedy? Could you compare Churchill with Liz Truss? 

üî∫Second, it was a different world. The West was still openly imperialist and didn‚Äôt yet learn to hide its motivations and use indirect colonization like it does now. For example, do you know that even in 1960s Britain owned a large part of Africa?

üî∫Third, it was different Russia. In fact, there was no Russia at all. Krutschev was the leader of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. 

üî∫Fourth, back then, mass media didn‚Äôt yet control minds of people in the West. We didn‚Äôt have internet, people were reading a lot, they were generally more intelligent and logical than they are now. Their minds weren‚Äôt spoiled by computer games, YouTube videos and other such things. World War 2 veterans were still active and in power and they did remember how Soviets and Western allies fought together against nazism. 

üî∫Fifth, it was a different West. There were still Jim Crow laws in the U.S. The West couldn‚Äôt present itself as an embodiment of morality as it is trying to do now. This role belonged to the USSR, which was the most progressive country of the time with the least level of discrimination and almost total equality of all citizens. 

üî∫Sixth, and most important, it was a different conflict. USSR was nothing like todays Russia. It had plenty of allies, huge combat-tested army in Europe, highly motivated people, second economy in the world with world‚Äôs best growth rate. Together with the Warsaw Pact countries USSR was indeed a match for the United States. 

As for now‚Ä¶ Russia has been pressured by NATO for decades, it was provoked to attack its own brotherly nation and was assigned a label of global villain. The West is fighting a shadow of USSR that no longer exists. USSR has voluntarily disbanded its military bloc and soon after that it collapsed into a group of countries. Borders of some of those countries had little to do with their history or the will of people living there. The process was not negotiated, interests of the people were not taken into account. 

This resulted in many civil conflicts on post-Soviet space, with Russian Federation acting as peacekeeper in all of those conflicts. Western leaders distort everything that is said about Russian actions and try to create false Russian image in eyes of their people and rest of the world. This is common between present days and Cold War times, however, in times of Cold War their people were not as easily manipulated.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,3380.0,16.0,2022-10-09T10:52:56+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,204.0,MessageEntityItalic,204.0,38.0,MessageEntityBold,2002.0,213.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,322.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,322.0,,,,,MessageReplies,35.0,25478.0,False,[],,9973.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""It should now be quite clear to any reasonable person that the Biden administration is hell-bent on destroying Russia and will risk nuclear war in doing so.¬† It has already started World War III with its use of Ukraine to light the final match.¬† 

...For years, the U.S.- run NATO has moved military forces and bases into countries encircling Russia. This includes weapons that can very quickly be converted to nuclear use.

In 2014, when the U.S. engineered a coup in Ukraine, bringing into power neo-Nazi elements, and Russia protested this coup on its western border, Washington mocked such concerns. Every time Russia has complained about such provocative moves, the U.S. has dismissed them as inconsequential.

For years the U.S. has supported the Ukrainian killing of the Russian speaking peoples of eastern Ukraine, and finally, when Ukraine had amassed forces to invade the Donbas region, the Russian government had had enough and sent troops into the region to defend this area.¬† Thus the hypocritical West played at outrage that what they had created was finally backfiring.¬† Russia was cast as the guilty party for invading Ukraine.¬† And now a full-fledged U.S. war against Russia is out in the open and it will become more dangerous as it continues.¬† Nuclear annihilation becomes a very real possibility as the Biden administration continues to push the envelope.

Biden is ¬´arming Ukraine to the hilt,¬ª having sanctioned ¬£2.5 billion of deadly weapons which could prolong the carnage for months or years. Wouldn't it be more humane if he gave more support to diplomatic efforts in Europe to get a cease-fire?

You are, of course, familiar with this trick that crooks use: with one hand they show you sparkling colored balls, and with the other, they climb into your pocket.

The question you are asked to answer fits perfectly into this scheme. You are invited to think about cease-fire and humanism ‚Äî which in itself is an oxymoron applied to the United States ‚Äî while in the reality the goal of the US is to suck dry Russia AMAP as far as the stocks of Ukrainian cannon fodder will allow.

Message,9514,1639836943,2022-10-07T17:39:06+00:00,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"¬´In the last few years, we've seen protests and revolts around the world, several of them in countries with an oppressive regime (Iran, Belarus, Syria, Venezuela). Why are Russians so docile in their response compared to other people?¬ª

All those listed protests and revolts, just like many others before them, have been fuelled by foreign countries, specifically by the West. Western countries think that the whole world must follow their way of life and tries to enforce what they see as freedom and democracy. 

It does not work this way. None of those countries listed live better after the protests. I‚Äôd have a hard time to name a country that really turned better because of protests and revolts. The list is long, but in most cases even successful revolts don‚Äôt change anything to the better, they just result in redistribution of power and increased influence of sponsors of the said revolts. 

When people really don‚Äôt want the oppressive regime, they don‚Äôt need any foreign interference. But again, when time passes, they can see that this oppressive regime was better than what they got as the result. With time, it is seen as a golden age. Do you know that some young Romanians are idealizing times of Ceaucescu?

Virtually all Russians idealize the period of Brezhnev‚Äôs rule as the Golden Age of the USSR, although previously they condemned it as ‚Äústagnation‚Äù. Moreover, there are millions of Russians who idealize the period of Stalin‚Äôs rule. If Stalin ran for Russian presidency today, he would win even over Putin.

üî∫Why are Russians so ‚Äúdocile‚Äù? They aren‚Äôt. In last 120 years Russia saw Russo-Japanese war, First Russian Revolution, World War I, February Revolution, October Revolution, the Civil War, the Polish War, the Winter War, World War II, the Cold War, the Afghan war, the Perestroika, fall of the USSR, revolt of 1993, the Chechen campaign, the War on Terror, 08/08/08, 2014 coup in Ukraine, the special operation of 2022‚Ä¶

I don‚Äôt think any other country or any other people would be able to survive it. 

Russian people had enough revolts in near past. More than enough. The lesson is learned well ‚Äî those who make a revolt don‚Äôt benefit from it. There is a chance that their children and grandchildren will live better, as it happened with The Great October 1917 Communist Revolution, but this chance is slim. 
Fortunately, Western standard programs don‚Äôt work on Russians really well. The West made many mistakes when attempting to prepare a color revolution in Russia. Financing Navalny was one of such mistakes. Russians dream of Stalin or Brezhnev, not the likes of Navalny. They don‚Äôt want pride parades and minority rights, they want better economy, megaprojects, great achievements, things to be proud of. Russians know the value of promises of democracy and better life. We heard those promises in 1990‚Äì1991. We saw what those promises were worth right in 1992. 

Russians are not docile, Russians are reasonable. And the West is making a big mistake when it hopes for Russian revolt and think that such revolt will be beneficial for the West. Stalin‚Äôs first place in the polls shows that the West won‚Äôt like changes that such revolts may bring.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2933.0,14.0,2022-10-07T17:50:29+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,237.0,MessageEntityUnderline,377.0,138.0,MessageEntityBold,541.0,63.0,MessageEntityBold,903.0,94.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,1194.0,29.0,MessageEntityBold,1226.0,147.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,1510.0,19.0,MessageEntityBold,1532.0,32.0,MessageEntityBold,1953.0,83.0,MessageEntityBold,2417.0,193.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,318.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,318.0,,,,,MessageReplies,9.0,25478.0,False,[],,9591.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

‚Äî Well, it looks quite reasonable to withdraw committment into a conflict world away, focus on internal development and profit on trade with the parties involved in this conflict. 

I think it‚Äôs more about choosing an enemy for the US. The US needs a global enemy to justify its defense industry, huge army and presence all around the globe. And I think that those Republicans think that Russia is not such an enemy. 

Russia is fighting ‚Äúeconomical war‚Äù with the West right now, a war that has been forced on it. While termination of Russian trade had a serious impact on Europe, the United States didn‚Äôt suffer from it. The United States get additional bonuses from economical weakness of Europe, as it becomes a large market for US products and services while European capitals flee to the safety of US federal bonds and securities.

‚ùóÔ∏èFirst, Putin didn‚Äôt say any threats about using nuclear weapons in Ukraine. These threats were invented by Western media that transformed subtle hints in his speech into direct and blatant threat.

‚ùóÔ∏èSecond, according to statements by U.S. officials, any use of tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine will result in conventional attack of NATO on Russia (like ‚Äúdestruction of Russian Black Sea Navy‚Äù). 

Such attack would automatically trigger use of strategical nuclear weapons against NATO. So, if Putin acts rationally, he won‚Äôt use tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine (and if desperate, he will start with strategical nuclear weapons). 

‚ùóÔ∏èThird, tactical nuclear weapons are not the best way to destroy armies, they are aimed to instill fear in their victims and eliminate stationary targets. Armies are spread over hundreds of kilometers and using tactical nukes against smaller groups is like using steam hammer to crack nuts. The order to spare civilians and civilian infrastructure hasn‚Äôt been rescinded by Russian high command, 

‚ùóÔ∏èFourth, use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine near Russian border or at territories claimed by Russia essentially means radioactive contamination of Russian own or claimed territory.

Russia is not fighting any energy war to win it or lose it. Russia is a large global supplier of energy and fuel.

High oil prices are beneficial for Russia and Saudi Arabia, two biggest oil producers. At the present state of global economy oil prices are not that relevant for Russia because Russia has little means to use extra oil profits without proper economical reforms and expansion of foreign trade. In fact, with reduced import volumes and unacceptable risks of foreign investments Russian state has little incentives to increase export.

‚Äî Of course, those are obvious benefits for the US, although it looks like American people don‚Äôt see any fruits of this transfer of wealth and increased markets for US products (including natural gas). Looks like most of the profits just end in pockets of those who are already rich. 

We don‚Äôt know what did the U.S.A. do to provoke Russian invasion of Ukraine. Yes, they were among those who started this conflict back in 2014 by supporting street rebels against legitimate government. Yes, they kept supporting Ukrainian government and turning eyes away from all their controversial actions even without any public or private reprimands. 

We can only guess what was the final straw that made Putin give the order. Atrocities in Donbass have continued for 8 years and he had all time in the world to intervene earlier. So while this was the official reason and it was a good and valid reason, the actual reason for choosing this specific time and method of intervention must indeed like somewhere else. Maybe it was ignorance towards Russian demands of NATO containment. 

Maybe it was about Zelensky‚Äôs speech in Munich where he mentioned a possibility of getting nuclear weapons for Ukraine. Maybe it was some covert secret related to U.S. biological weapon labs in Ukraine, which are still not explained. 

We can‚Äôt be sure that the U.S. did provoke the special operation of Russian Armed Forces in Ukraine, but we can be sure that the U.S. did all they could to extend the conflict and inflict maximum damage to Russia without actually becoming a side of the conflict. We can be sure that Ukraine has NATO weapons and NATO military advisors and well, they wouldn‚Äôt be there without approval of US. 

U.S. views about ending this conflict are quite intriguing. Even if their media screams otherwise, the decision makers surely know that there are no chances for Russian defeat without direct NATO intervention and such intervention would result in new World War. 

They know that they need to weaken Europe as potential competitor, but they don‚Äôt need to to destroy it because it must stay as market for their products and resources. There must be some point when they will say ‚Äúenough‚Äù to their puppets. 

The question is, when will this point come. American people are already questioning continued weapon supplies to Ukraine and excessful attention to the issue in times of numerous domestic problems. In fact, most Americans wouldn‚Äôt be able to show Ukraine on the map and this conflict doesn‚Äôt touch them personally despite all media attempts to incite their emotions. 

They are as indifferent about Ukraine as they were about Iraq, Afghanistan and millions other conflicts with U.S. involvement. As long as it doesn‚Äôt touch them personally, they don‚Äôt care. 

They care more about increasing gas prices than about anything that is happening in the Eastern Hemisphere. Most Americans don‚Äôt bother to look deeper into roots and specifics this conflict simply because they are not interested. 

They just repeat what they see on mainstream channels and it‚Äôs not because they are all stupid but because they are not interested. The Ukrainian conflict is as irrelevant for American masses as some conflict in Myanmar would be irrelevant for Russian masses.

‚Äî First of all, please clarify that you are talking about so called ‚ÄúWestern world‚Äù. About 75% of global population dont‚Äô care about changing anything in Russia. 

Russians know that the Western world can bark, bare teeth and all that but they also know that they will never dare to attack Russia openly, although they are always ready to do something nasty and keep inciting each other as a group of bullies circling around someone they nominated as an outcast. 

They keep insulting the poor soul, they incite each other to do more, they threaten, they mock. However, in this case the outcast is armed and dangerous and we all know how such stories end. 

Only saints have infinite patience. Some day some bully goes too far and‚Ä¶ Hopefully, leaders of the Western countries are not total wackos and understand that. 

Putin will decide his fate himself with support of Russian people. If he decides to run for the next term, Russian people will vote for him, or so the polls say. If he makes big mistakes, Russian people won‚Äôt vote for him. 

If he decides not to run for the next term, he will do whatever he thinks fit. In any case, rest of the world outside Russia doesn‚Äôt have any say in what happens here. Future of Russia will be decided by Russian people.

‚Äî Well, in this case the United States will face the same problem that Putin has right now. What if he doesn‚Äôt give in to the threat? Should they fulfill their promise and destroy the world? This is the problem of mutual guaranteed destruction. If nuclear war does happen, it won‚Äôt have any winners. 

Besides, Putin has already responded to such threat. I can remind you his words: ‚ÄúWe will go to heavens as martyrs and they will just die‚Äù. 

By the way, Putin is capable of civil talks. Russia is capable of civil talks and negotiations. 

The problem is that negotiatons require concessions from both sides. What the West is doing is called ‚Äúultimatums‚Äù. They are not offering any deals that could be acceptable to Russia and Putin. They are just making demands. It can‚Äôt be called ‚Äútalks‚Äù. 

The other problem is that the West doesn‚Äôt officially participate in this conflict. This gives them an obvious option to cheat and break their promises. For example, if they promise ceasefire but Ukraine continues military activities, they will just say: ‚ÄúWell, Ukraine is a free country, we can‚Äôt control them‚Äù. 

On the other hand, any negotiations between Russia and Ukraine are not possible while the West is strongly supporting Ukrainian war effort. This gives Ukraine false hopes of victory and forces Russia to raise stakes. If the West took the role of mediator instead of choosing a side, this would have been over in April. 

Russian and Ukrainian sides were ready for compromise back then, in fact Russian people would support the proposed deal about ‚Äúfreezing‚Äù the issue of Crimea and Donbass for a period of 20‚Äì30 years. All Russian demands have also been more or less addressed. It would be a real compromise and it would bring Ukraine much better results than it may get now, when new territories became a part of the Russian Federation and Russia has new ‚Äústart position‚Äù for talks. 

Putin has openly called Ukraine and the West to resume negotiations and end the conflict. We can‚Äôt say what compromise will he agree on, his options are getting more limited with time as Russia commits more and more to this conflict. 

However, I still think that he could agree on ‚Äúfreezing‚Äù the issue of recognition. He could agree on Ukraine being guaranteed by Western countries (and Russia) with their automatic involvement in case of any future conflict. 

That‚Äôs not NATO membership but the same benefits in terms of defense (just without NATO bases in the country that could threaten Russia). 

The tasks of demilitarization and denazification are partially fulfilled, I guess Putin can agree on some moderate solutions there, like laws prohibiting language-based discrimination. Maybe Putin could even agree on some financial compensation in form of humanitarian aid or favorable gas transit contracts (but not in form of compensation, this would cause him lose face). 

Maybe there still is a chance to end it peacefully and make the first step in a long road to reconciliation. Maybe there is no need to make this an existential issue and endanger the entire humankind.

‚Äî The most realistic and pragmatic approach would be to avoid choosing sides in conflict that doesn‚Äôt concern your country and yourself. 

However, the West didn‚Äôt just took a side in Ukrainian conflict making it global. They are also forcing others to choose sides. Strong players can ignore those demands, but weaker countries that are dependent on trade and cooperation with the West have no choice. 

Russia by itself is too weak and definitely not rich enough to support its friends in their endeavors to break with the West. Few countries support Russia and even less do so openly. 

Of course, many countries try to maintain neutrality. The Ukrainian conflict doesn‚Äôt matter anything for Asia, Africa, South America and Oceania. It‚Äôs not their problem and no hypothetical Russian or Ukrainian threat brings any risk for them. 

However, the conflict between Russia and the West does concern everyone simply because it may result in destruction of the world as we know it. We already hear calls to use nuclear weapons on both sides. This is extremely dangerous path. 
Neutral countries could unite and act more decisively to promote peace. However, it‚Äôs not so easy. 

Two powerful and influential countries, India and China, are trying to maintain neutrality, China even somewhat favors Russian side. Unfortunately, global weight of India and China is not sufficient to offset the risk of hostilities with the West and they are not ready for decisive actions and open support of neutral countries because this may result with them ending up on the Russian side and becoming new targets of the Western coalition.

Is it dangerous to choose? Yes.

I think this deserves some explanation.
 
1) Russians don‚Äôt justify actions in Ukraine by US involvement in most conflict in the worlds. They use this involvement not as an excuse but as an example of unfair treatment of Russia by Western community. Russia does nothing that US hasn‚Äôt done. In fact, Russia didn‚Äôt use US tactics of destroying logistical infrastructure (roads, bridges) and critical facilities (dams, power plants) to achieve swift victory. Like it was done in Iraq campaign, which was preceded by weeks of bombings of the country. 

2) Russians don‚Äôt fear the West but consider it an adversary that always has its hidden objectives and cannot be trusted. Due to certain specifics of US involvement, Russians think that only nuclear weapons saved them from invasion and occupation. Like they saved North Korea. 

3) Russians justify the actions in Ukraine solely with actions of Ukrainian government. If the West didn‚Äôt get involved in this conflict, this would be the only justification. Justification based on US actions usually comes from non-Russian sources. For example, many neutral countries view this conflict as a proxy war between Russia and NATO and their narrative of the situation matches this view. 

4) Russians view sanctions and attempts of international isolation of Russia as unfair specifically because of the said reasons. Did someone sanction U.S. for invasion of Iraq or Syria? Not that it would matter, but these interventions weren‚Äôt even officially condemned by any of the Western countries. 

5) The United States act solely in their own interests. Mainstream narrative is adapted to present those interests as ultimate good or hide them behind some benevolent reasons. NATO countries follow the U.S. as leader. Some of them may have their own opinion and even disagree with U.S. agenda but they don‚Äôt challenge the leader‚Äôs narrative.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,3062.0,10.0,2022-10-04T16:32:37+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,204.0,MessageEntityItalic,204.0,40.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,301.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,301.0,,,,,MessageReplies,10.0,25478.0,False,[],,9402.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If we are speaking about situation at the moment, then no. 
Not now. 

There could still be a large number of ‚Äúsausage voters‚Äù, i. e. people ready to abandon national ideas and cultural heritage for better life. However, most such people have already fled Russia. 

And they never were a majority. Significant minority - yes. But not majority. It would depend on circumstances and conditions, of course. For example, if EU completely changed, abandoned its most controversial liberal ideas returning to its pre-2005 ideology and joined Russia in its military operation, Russian would surely choose becoming a part of such EU. 

Not in last 10‚Äì15 years. Average Russians don‚Äôt like EU not only because they are geopolitical enemies and actual enemies at the moment. They don‚Äôt like European ultraliberal ideology, which is trying to enforce the idea that rights of minorities are superior to rights of majority. 

Sure, it would depend on specific circumstances and there would be a loud and numerous minority supporting this initiative, but the majority still wouldn‚Äôt accept it.
It would be possible something like before 2010. In 1990s all Russians would vote for it unanimously.

Russia does not need money to make weapons. That is because Russia really makes its own weapons, it doesn‚Äôt buy them, it is one of the largest weapon exporters in the world. 

Russia would need money only to import weapons or weapon components. This is not happening. Russia did import some secondary systems, but now they have been replaced by Russian-produced analogues.
 
To make weapons, Russia needs components and labor. To make components, Russia needs resources and labor. All of this is available. Russia doesn‚Äôt need to sell gas to ‚Äúmake money‚Äù. Money don‚Äôt matter in terms of real economy, especially in periods of military conflict.

Message,9113,1639836943,2022-10-03T08:25:09+00:00,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"Why are we sanctioning Russia when we depend on them for energy supply?

Sanctions against Russia were an attempt to cripple Russian military-industrial complex and create a hard time for Russian Armed Forces in Ukraine.

Both those objectives were not fulfilled. Russia has been weapon exporter for a long time and its military industrial complex was not dependent on import (and on external cash flow). 

Yes, some minor components were imported but nothing that couldn‚Äôt be replaced from local sources. Self-sufficient military industrial complex is an important aspect of a sovereign great power and Russia does have this aspect.

Russian Armed Forces in Ukraine don‚Äôt see any problem from sanctions. Soldiers are paid in rubles, their supplies come from local Russian sources. They have much more problems because of Western aid to Ukraine in form of military aid, mercenaries and NATO military advisors.

Sanctions against Russia resulted in some problems for Russian people. Fortunately, Russian government headed by Prime Minister Mishustin acted very smart and their brilliant and well-timed actions helped prevent economical crisis. Everything is fine in Russia. 

One last wave of the crisis (end of stock reserves of imported products and components that were available in Russia by February 2022) may hit Russia in a couple months, but the government had months to prepare for it, so I don‚Äôt think it will have any consequences.

Anyway, this sanction war has shown that both the West and Russia can survive without each other. However, people of both camps have problems because of trade termination. Not critical problems, but noticeable.

For Russia it‚Äôs more about absence of familiar brands, not about real shortage of something. No deficit of anything on consumer market.

For the West it‚Äôs increased energy costs that result in increased costs of anything. 

This is a long-term issue and now after North Stream explosions there is no easy way to bring energy costs down, even if Russia agrees to resume full supply. 

Ukrainian gas transit system is in a state of complete dilapidation and has been so for decades. Bringing it to modern safety standards would require investments comparable to costs of North Stream pipelines. 

And well, there will always be some political issue. By the way, despite Russian-Ukrainian military conflict those pipelines are still working. East European hawks say that they can meet all demands of Europe if needed.. in fact it‚Äôs a bit more complicated.

There is no simple solution to energy crisis in the West. The world will critically depend on fossil fuels for at least fifty more years. Nuclear option is available but electrical power can‚Äôt be used everywhere. 

Besides, Russia owns or controls a large part of global uranium reserves. By the way, North Stream pipeline was constructed with consideration of future green economy, it was adapted to transport hydrogen in addition to natural gas.

Well, that‚Äôs about it. Why are you sanctioning Russia? If you ask this question, it means that you are not sanctioning Russia. Your government is. Most likely they are doing so in solidarity with other Western governments. 

The United State of America has its own economical interests in sanctioning Russia. They did not depend on import from Russia and they don‚Äôt have much to lose. However, they get huge benefits and huge profit potential by replacing Russia as supplier of energy resources to Europe.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,3139.0,13.0,2022-10-03T08:28:58+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,71.0,MessageEntityBold,506.0,127.0,MessageEntityItalic,705.0,77.0,MessageEntityBold,1443.0,98.0,MessageEntityUnderline,1879.0,158.0,MessageEntityBold,2567.0,80.0,MessageEntityBold,2958.0,127.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,295.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,295.0,,,,,MessageReplies,2.0,25478.0,False,[],,9961.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I don¬¥t think that division between ‚Äúethnic‚Äù Russians and Ukranians reflects reality. Perhaps if you are comparing with something different, like ethnic distance between Scotts and British, that really have a different origin. Russian and Ukrainian ethnogenesis is not different in origin, is somewhat divergent from the same sources. A marriage between a Russian and an Ukrainian is not really considered a ‚Äúmixed‚Äù marriage over there, except in subhuman nazi minds. They are not a clearly separated people.

About 20 million Russians living in Russia have family ties to Ukrainians. Total ‚ÄúEthnic Russian‚Äù population in Ukrainie (the whole country) was about 8 millions before the war, that is around 19%, yet the ‚Äúpro-russian‚Äù alliance, when not banned, never were under 30‚Äì33% in elections, 40% was not a surprising result and 50% was what they got when Yakunovich was elected. 

You can say all you want about rigging but even with Zelensky in power, after 8 years of proscription and with a good share of their people having taken refuge in Russia and likely not voting, if we see the total suffrage, they still got 31‚Äì32% in 2021. Russian language is mother language to about 80% Ukrainian population. If you deduct the ‚ÄúEthnic russians‚Äù from there you get that 72% of the Country¬¥s population are ‚Äúethnic Ukrainians‚Äù with Russia as their mother language.

Let¬¥s get clear on something: i don¬¥t deny Ukrainian identity, but the usage of ‚ÄúEthnic‚Äù partition by nazi ideologists, making Ukrainian and Russian of different ethnic pool origin with the late being ‚Äústeppe ugrian‚Äù or all that bullshit is an insult to historiography and pure irrational, subhuman nazi crap. Ukrainian and Russian identity started to part away much later. The problem with many arguments about the role of Ukrainian identity on this war is that it makes much of that Nazi bullshit to smashes against reality.

So, there is a hard reality that there are AT LEAST as many ‚ÄúEthnic Ukrainians‚Äù supporting the Russian side of the story than there is Ukrainian-born ‚ÄúEthnic Russians‚Äù. Donbass region did not secede due to ‚ÄúRussian nationalism‚Äù, it secede because of economic reasons: they have commercial ties with Russia that they new Kiev policies wanted to sever. 

They were the regions of highest income in the country before 2014 due to these ties, and they knew that those new policies were about to bring neoliberal bullshit reforms that would greatly impoverish the country starting with them, as it did, because they come not only to ban Russian language but also to dismantle the little Ukrainian industry still working, as they did. Ukraine has the GDP per capita of Paraguay before 2014 but it went down to the numbers of Bolivia (the poorest country in Latin America besides Venezuela and Haiti) after that year.

There were plenty of reasons to secede, material reasons that little had to do with Russian nationalism.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,4180.0,21.0,2022-09-30T12:50:00+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityHashtag,0.0,12.0,MessageEntityBold,1177.0,226.0,MessageEntityBold,2100.0,184.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,294.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,294.0,,,,,MessageReplies,17.0,25478.0,False,[],,9958.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No. 90 percent of Ukrainians don‚Äôt want to be a part of Russia. Or at least we don‚Äôt know that yet. Referendums were held only in Donbass region that has separated from Ukraine over 8 years ago and in Kherson region and part of Zaporozhye region controlled by Russian armed forces.
With Donbass everything is clear. After 8 years of constant attacks and shelling they will better die than return to Ukraine. 

As for Kherson and Zaporozhye regions, referendum results are probably realistic because all people who would vote ‚ÄúNo‚Äù have fled those regions. However, if we look at participation numbers and at the number of refugees (by comparing data on population before Russian operation with the number of voters), we‚Äôll see that majority still has voted for being a part of Russia, although this majority is not as overwhelming as current numbers, closer to 60 percent (if we assume that all refugees would vote ‚ÄúNo‚Äù).

Specifically, before special operation Kherson region had population about 1 million (including children). About 330,000 people voted at the referendum for joining Russia (this number doesn‚Äôt include refugees staying in Russia and constitutes 75% of registered voters).",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,4036.0,22.0,2022-09-29T14:38:04+00:00,,,[],,MessageMediaPhoto,5.310284637379085e+18,-6.91331140563625e+18,"[2, 97, 189, 237, 15, 0, 0, 34, 160, 99, 245, 147, 107, 111, 154, 191, 0, 41, 35, 149, 210, 112, 12, 200, 122, 1, 206, 104, 159]",2.0,False,[],,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,169.0,MessageEntityBold,1198.0,162.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,291.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,291.0,,,,,MessageReplies,9.0,25478.0,False,[],,10164.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,i,"[1, 28, 40, 210, 184, 89, 91, 105, 137, 128, 199, 92, 147, 81, 149, 151, 114, 254, 247, 35, 118, 79, 110, 41, 247, 37, 176, 20, 14, 13, 36, 124, 168, 235, 199, 181, 103, 41, 59, 217, 13, 8, 243, 67, 27, 21, 105, 72, 32, 116, 44, 120, 165, 91, 152, 128, 1, 88, 185, 39, 28, 115, 138, 165, 123, 110, 29, 154, 69, 39, 113, 227, 29, 170, 75, 85, 17, 2, 23, 56, 61, 234, 147, 212, 109, 105, 114, 220, 50, 187, 59, 6, 66, 163, 60, 18, 40, 162, 48, 12, 155, 136, 4, 250, 227, 154, 42, 137, 220, 142, 237, 119, 74, 187, 84, 110, 218, 126, 109, 216, 197, 75, 8, 41, 6, 28, 130, 125, 142, 105, 230, 53, 98, 24, 131, 156, 122, 154, 118, 0, 232, 40, 2, 149, 220, 18, 201, 22, 19, 110, 211, 215, 119, 31, 74, 108, 69, 163, 141, 3, 41, 115, 156, 29, 157, 170, 121, 109, 18, 73, 119, 151, 112, 115, 208, 30, 42, 95, 41, 64, 56, 224, 158, 253, 233, 220, 58, 12, 138, 70, 51, 50, 20, 33, 71, 67, 142, 189, 40, 165, 88, 85, 88, 96, 158, 49, 199, 20, 82, 3]",m,320.0,221.0,24026.0,x,644.0,445.0,"[5533, 54765, 59001]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am most annoyed and somewhat alarmed by the West‚Äôs blind support for a corrupt, kleptocrat fascist regime in Kyiv and the hysterical Russophobia. And the public‚Äôs willingness to overlook Kyiv‚Äôs many documented flaws. They are being primed to be fascism apologists, without even knowing it.

I don‚Äôt support the invasion of Ukraine nor the annexation but do recognize that Ukraine has a neo-Nazi problem that targets ethnic Russians, & more broadly anyone who isn‚Äôt an ethnic Ukrainian and that the people in Crimea and Donbass have legitimate reasons not to want to be ruled by Kyiv. Partition is the inevitable solution. Berlin and Paris failed to keep the peace through diplomacy. The jury is still out on why.

As for Macron. French public opinion is very sceptical of Kyiv. The French aren‚Äôt knee jerk Russophobes, either. The last time France went to war against Russia was back in Napoleon times and the two countries have mostly been allies since.

I don‚Äôt like Macron and I think he‚Äôs pretty useless as a diplomat. But his relatively cautious and neutral position on the war in Ukraine reflects French public opinion. If anything, he is more pro-Kyiv than the general public. Any of his pro-Kyiv tweets in French are quickly swamped with criticism of supporting the ‚Äúclown‚Äù in Kyiv, aka Zelensky.

French news media echoes the public‚Äôs low opinion of Zelensky. So my views are fairly mainstream in France.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,3636.0,12.0,2022-09-29T08:59:12+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityHashtag,0.0,12.0,MessageEntityBold,411.0,113.0,MessageEntityBold,995.0,67.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,290.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,290.0,,,,,MessageReplies,17.0,25478.0,False,[],,10635.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the 1980s, the US and Britain backed Saddam in the war against Iran, giving Iraq arms, money, satellite intelligence, and even chemical & bio-weapon precursors. As many as 90 US military advisors supported Iraqi forces and helped pick targets for Iraqi air and missile attacks.‚Äù
I guess they were implying how the west put in power these people and then demonized them afterwards when they deemed them not useful.

As for the gulag part: obviously it‚Äôs condemned. They were officially closed in 1960 (as were the British gulags in Kenia-1,5-2 millions dead/ and speaking of starvation: 3 millions of Indians due to Churchill policies as of ww2)

Could mobilization provoke widespread anger at Putin while offering little short-term help on the battlefield? There is no simple way to train, equip and find officers for a vast new army. The process would probably take more than a year?

- Highly unlikely. Firstly, during all the opinion polls conducted in Russia including those of made by western or western backed sociologists, the result has been that Russian overwhelmingly support both Putin and the war effort. Statista reports that in August 2022, so about a month ago, 80% of Russians supported the war. 

Recent events might have changed this slightly, but a military defeat in the field doesn‚Äôt make people abandon the war effort, it usually makes them more angry and determined to fight on. England didn‚Äôt give up in WW2, because they lost France, on the contrary it made them get serious.

As for offering little help, increasing the formations of the army to full strength is not going to do nothing. Again, do you really think Russia would spent billions on a joke? Massive logistical and economic strain is not something you do because it has no impact.

In my estimation, the full impact of the mobilization will not be felt for some time, possibly several months, for various reasons. But have no doubt, it will have some impact. Will it mean a drastic reversal for Ukraine? Maybe not, but once it is fully deployed, it is quite likely you‚Äôll notice.

As for your premise there is no simple way to train equip and find officers for a vast army, you are wrong. That is the point of reservists. When an officer leaves the army, they become part of the officer reserve. And Russia had an excess of officers in the past. They don‚Äôt need to train officers, these guys are already trained. 

Maybe they will need a refresher course, however that will not take long. As for equipment, the Russian arsenals were made for supplying an army of up to 4 million in war time. Supplying 300,000 will probably not be a problem. You are somehow thinking that reservists are new recruits.

Why does the Russian economy keep beating expectations? Few thought it would be holding up six months into the war.

Because the strength of Russian economy was greatly underestimated. Russian industrial capacity is much higher than it was expected and although there are some problems, they are not critical. Western technological superiority was also overrated. It turned out that Russian technologies are good enough.

Western economists and analysts are far from real world. They live in the world of bubbles and fictional value. They have forgotten the basics. In bubble world Russian economy is already destroyed. The bubble is gone, stock market has crashed back in March. In real world it doesn‚Äôt matter as long as Russia does have real things it needs. Food, construction materials, energy.

Many foreign companies have left Russia but they couldn‚Äôt take their assets. Their factories are now working for Russian owners and producing the same or almost the same things. This ‚Äúdependence‚Äù was fictional and this change is in fact beneficial for Russia. Of course, Russian oligarchs aren‚Äôt much better than global corporations, but at least they keep investing in Russia and are no longer willing to move their money out.

Now it‚Äôs up to Russian businessmen to use those opportunities.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,3285.0,11.0,2022-09-27T16:12:03+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,9.0,MessageEntityBold,634.0,142.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,279.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,279.0,,,,,MessageReplies,2.0,25478.0,False,[],,8682.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It‚Äôs not about believing. And it‚Äôs not about Russians but about their leaders. Words are just words. Empty words.

Geopolitics looks at potentials.

The examples of people like Saddam and the last Lybian leader shows that the West cannot be trusted. The West is not monolithic, but their groups of power support each other when the decision is made. Sure, not everyone in US elites was fond about invasion of Iraq, all decision-makers perfectly knew that chemical weapons are a fake, some may have opposed it, but when the decision was made, the entire Western block joyously approved this.

The Western block has clear goal - to preserve their economical and military superiority and to keep status quo by thriving over the rest of the world. Leader of the Western block, the United States of America has additional goal to prevent other countries and entities in this block from getting too powerful and challenging their status as ultimate decision maker.

The Western block has clear enemies - all countries that can challenge their superiority in any aspects. This is especially true about economical superiority.

Russian attempt to create a Eurasian Union could create such a challenger. With Ukraine this Union would be a viable entity with over 250 million consumers. In a few decades it could emerge as a competing economical power. In addition to military potential of Russia, this would create unacceptable challenge. That is the ultimate reason for Western interference in Ukraine in 2014 and one of the roots of current events.

The West doesn‚Äôt want to destroy Russia. It wants Russia weak and controllable. It wants Russia as a ‚Äúglobal gas station‚Äù with most profits ultimately going to Wall Street pockets.

Russia is not the only entity weakened by this crisis. It also hurts Europe. Cooperation between Russia and Europe, especially between Russia and Germany could change the situation with the entire Europe virtually being economical and political vassal of the United States.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,3348.0,14.0,2022-09-27T16:12:46+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,68.0,MessageEntityBold,183.0,34.0,MessageEntityBold,1611.0,182.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,275.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,275.0,,,,,MessageReplies,9.0,25478.0,False,[],,9285.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A crash video with¬† Zelensky has appeared. It can be seen that the driver of the second car was seriously injured. Afterwards, he was taken by ambulance. The president of Ukraine was evacuated before.

The press-secretary of the Ukrainian president names the road accident a ""clash"", though it is evident from the video that the vehicle from the country leader's motorcade severely damaged the car of a Kiev citizen ‚Äî the front part of the car shattered. The victim apparently broke his ribs, suffered a traumatic brain injury and was unable to move.

At the same time, Zelensky is safe and sound ‚Äî an hour after the incident, in his "" minute of hate,"" he was already insulting Russians and continuing his fantastic rhetoric about ""victories"" at the front.

Meanwhile, the main Western media hardly write anything about the victim, give no footage and differ in the testimony of who was the man.

The British East India Company‚Äôs council of 300 in time became the Committee of 300. Today, through many powerful alliances, the Committee of 300 rules the world and is the driving force behind the criminal agenda to create a ""New World Order"", under a ""Totalitarian Global Government"".

The inner circle of the Committee of 300 is the 
Order of the Garter, which is headed by none other than Queen Elizabeth II.

These aristocrats decided at the death of Queen Victoria, the matriarch of the Venetian Black Guelphs that, in order to gain world-wide control, it would be necessary for its aristocratic members to ""go into business"" with the non-aristocratic but extremely powerful leaders of corporate business on a global scale, and so the doors to ultimate power were opened to what the Queen of England likes to refer to as ""the commoners"", now known as the global
corporate elite.

Through their illicit banking cartel, they own the stock of the Federal Reserve, which is a private for profit corporation that violates U.S. Constitution and through their many think tanks and social and political organisations they control and manipulate ideologies, policies, societal psychology and the ultimate perception of reality. 

All the families listed in the committee are connected with the House of Guelph, one of the original Black Nobility families of Venice from which the House of Windsor and thus Queen Elizabeth II, descends.

This is who died today. 

Humanity should be celebrating, but the veil of deception is so thick and intricately woven that the world will instead mourn the loss of a woman they believe ‚Äòdedicated her life to service‚Äô.

Ukrainian Telegram channel Resident, citing its sources, reports that data has been prepared for the Office of the President on the negative trend of Ukraine's population decline. 

‚úîÔ∏è It is noted that the figure of 40-42 million is only for statistics. Even before the Russian special operation, the real population barely exceeded 33-34 million, with the Luhansk and Donetsk regions also counted. 

‚úîÔ∏èAbout 7 million left Ukraine after the outbreak of hostilities. Minus Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk and Russian-controlled territories in Zaporizhzhia, Kherson and Kharkov regions. 

‚úîÔ∏è It is noted that there are now about 19-20 million left in Ukraine, which is half as many as there were before.

‚ùóÔ∏èOnce there is a whole range of problems, from labour shortages and shrinking tax bases to military conscription. The losses, even at the lower end of the scale Zaluzhny claimed, are becoming far more tangible.

They will take this step if the government orders the operators to reduce electricity consumption by 20%, writes  Radio T√©l√©vision Suisse.

Cable cars consume as much electricity as 40 thousand Swiss homes a year. In this case, analysts warn that the shutdown will lead to a reduction in tourist flow and reduce the proceeds to the treasury. In addition, a large number of workers in the tourism sector could lose their jobs.

Message,6403,1639836943,2022-08-24T05:31:10+00:00,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"More excerpts from my recent article on Ukrainian-fired Petal mines littering the streets of Donetsk & surrounding cities:

""...As with most of its war crimes against the civilians of the Donbass, Ukraine and NATO media invert reality and claim Russia is the guilty party. They cry crocodile tears for the Donetsk children Ukraine has targeted, also disingenuously claiming the now-famous video of a DPR soldier detonating a mine by throwing a tire at it was a Ukrainian soldier demining Russian-fired mines.

The notion that Russia would explode mines over the city is not a reality-based idea. Most of the population are ethnic Russians, a significant number who now happily hold Russian citizenship. And further, it is Russian and DPR sappers putting themselves at risk to clear the streets, walks and fields of the mines.

In fact, a 21 year old DPR sapper lost a foot to such mine. Director of the Department of Fire and Rescue Forces of the Ministry of Emergency Situations of the Donetsk People‚Äôs Republic, Colonel Sergey Neka, told me of his injury: ‚ÄúAfter the cleansing of territories from explosive objects, returning back to the transport, a mine fell from the building, as a result of which it exploded under his feet and he lost his foot.‚Äù

In Makeevka, Igor Goncharov, the Chief Physician of the bombarded orphanage, spoke to me about his anger that Ukraine was targeting the property, insisting it had been deliberate, that since 2001 the orphanage was well-known to various international organizations, as well as Kiev, because, ‚ÄúIt was the only one specialized in HIV.‚Äù

According to him, ‚ÄúAmerican law allowed the adoption of HIV-positive children, so the United States was the only state that adopted HIV-infected children, so we were well known both within Ukraine and the Russian Federation and abroad. When they shoot, they know where they shoot,‚Äù he said of Ukraine.

‚ÄúEven without being educated in military matters, it‚Äôs easy to localize the craters. Which way they are located indicates which side they were sent from. We know perfectly well where they shoot from. It‚Äôs all from Peski, Avdeevka, Nevelskoye. You can hear the crash and the whistle coming first. Ballistics can be defined. All the shelling comes from the Ukrainian side, it is unambiguous.‚Äù

Even without that logical thinking, let‚Äôs recall that Ukraine has been committing war crimes in the Donbass for over eight years, violating the Minsk Accords signed in 2014 and 2015. That Ukraine would use Petal mines from its enormous stockpile, after already shelling and sniping civilians, it not at all out of the question.

Ukrainian nationalists openly declare they view Russians as sub-human. School books teach this warped ideology. Videos show the extent of this mentality: teaching children not only to also hate Russians and see them as not humans, but also brainwashing them to believe killing Donbass residents is acceptable. The Ukrainian government itself funds Neo-Nazi-run indoctrination camps for youths.

As mentioned at the start, Ukraine signed the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention, under which Ukraine was obliged to destroy its 6 million stock of the mines. However, reportedly, its stockpile remains over 3.3 million such mines.

The convention, ‚Äúprohibits the use, stockpiling, production, and transfer of anti-personnel landmines (APLs).‚Äù Further, as outlined, Ukraine is, ‚Äúin violation of Article 5 of the Mine Ban Treaty due to missing its 1 June 2016 clearance deadline without having requested and being granted an extension.

Ukraine‚Äôs firing of rockets containing these mines is against international law and the Geneva Conventions. Ukraine is specifically targeting civilian areas with them. It is pure terrorism. And it is another Ukrainian war crime in a very long list of war crimes stretching back over eight years.‚Äù",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,5003.0,15.0,,Eva,,[],,MessageMediaWebPage,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityTextUrl,19.0,20.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,8259.0,,,,,,,,MessageReplies,0.0,25478.0,False,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WebPage,9.170793121632556e+18,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1381044150.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

¬†
üîµ On 5-6 August the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) once again attacked ZNPP by shelling the critically important infrastructural objects of the plant as well as its satellite city Energodar. Twenty shells have been fired during the strikes

üîµ On 5 August, at 14:45, the Ukrainian shelling (three shells hit in the proximity of the training centre next to the territory of the open switchgear of the NPP) resulted in shutdown of the autotransformer and the high voltage line providing backup power to the Units ‚Ññ1 and ‚Ññ2 of ZNPP

üîµ On 5 August, at 16:45, the Ukrainian side committed an artillery shelling (four shells) of oil and fuel oil handling equipment and the site of hydrogen receivers. Damage of the pipeline caused jet fire that was localized due to timely and professional actions of ZNPP personnel and Russian military

üîµ On 6 August, at 19:42, the AFU units attacked ZNPP once again. Three artillery shells of 155 millimeters caliber (NATO standard) exploded next to the spent fuel storage and only 200 meters from the operating unit. One person was injured

üîµ On 7 August ZNPP was again shelled by the Ukrainian armed formations. The high-voltage power line ‚ÄúKakhovskaya‚Äù was damaged. Equipment of an open switchgear (750 kW) was damaged as a result of a power surge. At Unit ‚Ññ4, that was operational at 10% capacity, the power supply of control and safety system went offline. This triggered the emergency protection of the Unit ‚Ññ4

üîµ The Ukrainian personnel of the plant has decided on cooldown of the Unit¬†‚Ññ4 of ZNPP, as well as downpower of the Units ‚Ññ5 and ‚Ññ6. Currently, the Units ‚Ññ5 and ‚Ññ6 are downpowered to 500 MW

üîµ On 11 August Ukrainian armed formations again tried to attack the ZNPP with missiles and UAVs. This attack was repulsed by the air defense forces

üîµ In addition to direct military threats to the security of ZNPP the Kiev regime is working on other scenarios to create intentional preconditions for a nuclear accident at ZNPP. Inter alia, Kiev is considering different options of cutting the plant off from the Ukrainian power grid and keeps increasing psychological pressure on ZNPP employees and their relatives (they regularly receive phone calls threatening them with criminal prosecutions and physical reprisals)

üîµ Attacks of the Kiev regime on ZNPP endanger the safety and security of Europe and the whole world. In case of an accident at this station the radiation contamination zone (more than 5300 square kilometers, length around 420 km) would cover the population of Kievskaya, Zaporozhskaya, Kharkovskaya, Poltavskaya, Khersonskaya, Odesskaya, Nikolaevskaya, Kirovogradskaya, Vinnitskaya oblasts, Donetsk and Lugansk People‚Äôs Republics, border areas of Russia and Belarus, as well as Moldova, Bulgaria and Romania. The situation could get worse because of adverse weather conditions and spread of possible contamination zone to South-Ukrainian NPP and the nuclear fuel storage at Chernobyl NPP, as well as water arteries. The Black Sea and the Bosphorus Strait would become unsuitable for navigation for a long time. The shores of Abkhazia, Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania and T√ºrkiye would be contaminated with high levels of radiation

Liebe Befreier des Donbass und der Ukraine von Nazismus und dem Banderakult. Es schreiben euch Russlanddeutsche aus Deutschland. In der russlanddeutschen Diaspora gibt es etwa f√ºnf Millionen von uns. Zwei Drittel der Befragten unterst√ºtzen Putin und euer Handeln. 

Wir machen uns Sorgen um euch und w√ºnschen uns, dass alle lebendig und gesund nach Hause zur√ºckkehren. Den Menschen in der Ukraine w√ºnschen wir Frieden. 

Die Deutschen in Russland haben vor 80 Jahren zusammen mit allen V√∂lkern der UdSSR viel Schreckliches durchgemacht. Wir erinnern uns an die Geschichte und wollen nicht, dass sie sich wiederholt. 
In unserer Diaspora sind viele Organisationen entstanden, die viel f√ºr den Erhalt des Friedens und der Freundschaft zwischen Deutschland und Russland tun.
Im Jahr 2016 besuchten die ersten Volksdiplomaten die Krim, Donezk und Lugansk. Die Volksdiplomaten haben mehr als zwanzig Mal Delegationen zusammengestellt, und jedes Mal waren neue Leute dabei. Im selben Jahr schlossen sich uns Volksdiplomaten aus Norwegen, Holland, √ñsterreich und Belgien an. Sie konnten nicht glauben, dass die Medien alles falsch darstellten. 

Auf ihren Reisen durch den Donbass trafen sie Verteidiger und einfache Menschen. Sie verneigten sich vor dem Mut der Rebellen. Nach ihrer R√ºckkehr nach Deutschland sammelten sie Hilfsg√ºter, um das Zerst√∂rte wieder aufzubauen. Wir haben jede Gelegenheit genutzt, um die Wahrheit dar√ºber zu sagen, was in der Ukraine wirklich passiert. 

Auf einer dieser Reisen haben wir ein Waisenhaus besucht. Wir waren umgeben von Kindern, deren Eltern von der ukrainischen Armee get√∂tet worden waren. Sie schenkten uns ihre Zeichnungen. Sie forderten Frieden und dass Kinder nicht zu Waisen werden sollten. Am ""Tag der Kinder"" haben wir in Deutschland Kundgebungen abgehalten, bei denen wir diese Zeichnungen gezeigt haben. 

Wir beginnen jeden Tag mit einem ""Informationsbulletin"". Wir erkl√§ren die Nachrichten der j√ºngsten Generation und denjenigen, die keine Informationen aus Russland bekommen. Wir als russischsprachige Deutsche haben die M√∂glichkeit, zu vergleichen und zu analysieren. Was Europa in den Medien und im Internet sagt und tut. Wir haben den Kontakt zu unseren Freunden in Russland und der Ukraine nicht verloren. 

Unter den Russlanddeutschen gibt es viele Gl√§ubige, die in ihren Gottesdiensten f√ºr ein baldiges Ende des Konflikts und f√ºr Frieden beten. Damit alle lebendig und gesund nach Hause zur√ºckkehren k√∂nnen. 
Sie beten, dass die Politiker endlich begreifen, dass es nicht auf Druck durch Gewalt und Waffen ankommt, sondern auf Vertrauen und Verhandlungen. 

M√∂ge Gott Ihnen Kraft, Gesundheit und Sieg schenken!

12.08.22. Deutschland.

The Russian military continue shelling the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. This creates a nuclear threat to the entire world. Sanctions should be imposed on Rosatom and the Russian nuclear energy industry should be paralysed. Vladimir Zelensky said so in his video message.

The fact:
This fake has nothing to do with reality. First of all, it is important to remember that it is the Ukrainian Armed Forces, not the Russian troops, who are shelling the nuclear power plant facilities. There was a detailed breakdown of this published by our project. The shelling was carried out by one of the units of the 45th AFU Artillery Brigade from positions near the village of Marganets, which is under the control of the Ukrainian army. 
Due to the recent shelling, the fourth power unit at the nuclear power plant is now out of service. The fire that broke out at the site of the shells' arrival was quickly extinguished by specialists, but the hydrogen line needs to be restored. Fortunately, the shells did not hit the oxygen plant building, so a larger fire was avoided.

It is revealing that the Ukrainian president's statement and the shelling of nuclear power plants by the Ukrainian Armed Forces coincide very closely with the nuclear non-proliferation conference in New York. By doing so, Kiev is trying to shift the focus of Western media attention as much as possible, making Russia the main threat to the peaceful life and security of European countries.

The Russian Foreign Ministry has repeatedly called on the UN, the IAEA and countries with influence over Kiev to stop the shelling of a nuclear power plant. Now the facts of the attacks are already counted in dozens, and the threat of a catastrophe that could occur is comparable in scale to Chernobyl.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,2695.0,11.0,,,1.32814768257409e+16,[],,MessageMediaPhoto,5.438415395993272e+18,2.2846753979624456e+18,"[2, 97, 189, 237, 15, 0, 0, 21, 164, 99, 245, 147, 136, 114, 63, 175, 187, 96, 2, 240, 107, 222, 34, 104, 178, 164, 165, 185, 2]",2.0,False,[],,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,11.0,MessageEntityBold,288.0,10.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,537.0,9.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,827.0,14.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,1517.0,9.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,1733.0,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,620.0,,,,,,,,MessageReplies,0.0,25478.0,False,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1799870292.0,i,"[1, 40, 27, 179, 28, 242, 49, 198, 252, 254, 20, 239, 181, 58, 206, 35, 42, 72, 254, 246, 69, 66, 37, 88, 16, 200, 222, 181, 77, 238, 139, 77, 230, 0, 61, 113, 138, 67, 54, 76, 142, 59, 254, 148, 223, 53, 253, 127, 74, 130, 59, 128, 232, 25, 198, 220, 211, 188, 196, 254, 245, 0, 78, 201, 17, 27, 89, 1, 30, 152, 20, 209, 5, 183, 252, 241, 67, 255, 0, 1, 21, 41, 94, 122, 26, 77, 158, 198, 152, 134, 133, 128, 0, 4, 75, 143, 247, 69, 72, 34, 143, 251, 139, 249, 82, 108, 62, 149, 32, 24, 24, 160, 6, 3, 207, 67, 249, 82, 228, 251, 254, 148, 81, 64, 6, 126, 191, 165, 46, 71, 173, 20, 80, 7]",m,215.0,320.0,20696.0,x,433.0,643.0,"[3761, 9806, 21307, 32002, 49114]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Russian Army has scattered anti-personnel mines PFM-1 and PFM-1S Lepestok in Donetsk city centre. Several Czech media reported about it at once, citing the UK Defence Ministry.

The fact:
This is a fake, which has been actively promoted in recent days by Ukrainian propaganda via the Ukrainian and Western media. Lepestok anti-personnel mines were in fact scattered in Donetsk, except that this was not done by Russian troops, the Ukrainian armed forces did it. Earlier, they had shelled Lysychansk, Makiivka, Izyum and Yasinovataya with this type of mine.

At the start of the special operation, the Ukrainian army had more than 3.3 million anti-personnel mines in its stockpiles. Kyiv has not destroyed them, despite the fact that the country ratified the Ottawa Convention, which bans the use, stockpiling and production of anti-personnel mines, back in 2005.

The fact that Lepestok mines are being scattered by the Ukrainian military is also confirmed by local residents in the city's Telegram channels (see screenshot). Internet users have been questioning themselves why the Russians would scatter these mines in Donetsk if they are already deployed in Donetsk and are engaged in their elimination.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,6605.0,16.0,,,1.3281473418660828e+16,[],,MessageMediaPhoto,5.447318399341413e+18,8.093987738676138e+18,"[2, 97, 189, 237, 15, 0, 0, 21, 158, 99, 245, 147, 136, 74, 75, 93, 223, 227, 116, 95, 159, 184, 245, 246, 161, 23, 186, 228, 200]",2.0,False,[],,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,11.0,MessageEntityBold,193.0,10.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,469.0,6.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,495.0,7.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,702.0,17.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,641.0,,,,,,,,MessageReplies,0.0,25478.0,False,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1799870292.0,i,"[1, 30, 40, 212, 43, 243, 30, 91, 243, 163, 96, 254, 249, 252, 205, 86, 123, 189, 183, 44, 140, 191, 40, 61, 104, 107, 190, 114, 170, 54, 227, 190, 105, 92, 11, 34, 53, 29, 88, 159, 196, 211, 182, 41, 24, 201, 255, 0, 190, 141, 81, 55, 164, 17, 242, 46, 15, 185, 169, 99, 185, 44, 138, 193, 6, 75, 98, 139, 129, 104, 46, 211, 198, 121, 247, 162, 160, 23, 47, 230, 42, 249, 71, 4, 227, 62, 148, 81, 112, 43, 207, 24, 243, 152, 242, 73, 63, 128, 168, 24, 128, 229, 1, 7, 29, 235, 77, 225, 89, 51, 144, 14, 122, 242, 106, 49, 103, 23, 247, 7, 175, 83, 74, 195, 185, 149, 32, 32, 147, 144, 199, 183, 165, 95, 176, 79, 50, 216, 49, 56, 33, 137, 169, 190, 199, 17, 235, 26, 254, 102, 156, 85, 45, 163, 218, 171, 128, 79, 74, 18, 16, 240, 184, 198, 8, 227, 222, 138, 142, 57, 65, 144, 40, 92, 102, 138, 160, 63]",x,800.0,599.0,106288.0,y,850.0,636.0,"[6903, 19335, 38497, 56556, 88884]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The force of the explosion is enough to blow off a leg. In fact, that's what they're designed for. Since there is no metal there, they are practically not detected by mine detectors. They are green, so they are very hard to see in the grass, foliage. This mine is against the civilians. 2 kg causes an explosion, after which a person is left without a leg.

Message,5104,1639836943,2022-08-03T19:39:22+00:00,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"‚ÄãThe Taiwan,¬†China-US crisis has overshadowed Ukraine in the media field and in the people‚Äôs minds that were so much busy following the Nancy Pelosi flight.

We are living in an era in which international politics and the threat of full-fledged global war appear to laypeople to be more like fun and a computer game than a dire disaster.They are scared, but in the depth of their hearts they would love to see this happen.¬†

To expect China to down the jet of Nancy Pelosi was quite insane, since that would mean direct aggression against the United States. Beijing is wise enough not to hand Washington such trump cards.¬†However, the visit itself took place despite the endless requests and warnings from China. Thus,¬†Sino-American relations were significantly damaged. The fact that the US doesn‚Äôt respect any state‚Äôs national interests unless they match their own is common knowledge. Now it has just another proof. For the US to make this visit happen, despite the White House's attempts to disown that visit, is¬†obviously a part of the game and a way to demonstrate the US might and to show China its place according to the US estimations and US concept of the globe. It's very unlikely that China will agree with these estimations. I can assume as well that Taiwan is becoming a kind of blackmailing instrument: Taiwan in return for abandoning the Beijing-Moscow partnership. This might be attractive to the part of the CCP establishment that is pro-US (in the sense of pro-business and pro-big money). But that is unacceptable for the opposite camp, to which belongs Xi Jinping himself, that is¬†pro-China, pro-multipolar world and pro-independence of the country.

However, the current developments and the way Washington treats China are likely to reconcile the CCP party from within and force it to find compromises¬†since the US moves significantly damage Chinese national pride and eloquently reveal the US approach and far-reaching plans (multiplied by the NATO expansion in Asia and NATO‚Äôs new strategic concept that defined China as a ‚Äúsystematic challenge‚Äù to the Alliance). And the declared intentions of the US and the signals they¬†send¬†about how far things might go. The key point that the whole CCP unconditionally agrees on is that: ¬´Taiwan is China¬ª. Furthermore, it is important to bear in mind that the CCP can‚Äôt leave the current game launched by the US without a response, since in the eyes of the Chinese people this will be considered a weakness and will likely undermine their trust in the leadership.¬†

China has announced unprecedented military drills around Taiwan and in the Taiwanese territorial waters with missile launches that are supposed to fly through the Taiwanese airspace. Approximately 200 000 PLA military personnel have been placed on alert. 
In the case of the assault, scenario we can‚Äôt dismiss, that would be a provoked assault on Taiwan, not on Pelosi or the US. And if so, that would be a big question if the US took a risk and militarily responded to China. If they went for sanctions, the option they love the most, the consequences would be more catastrophic¬†for the Western world and its economy¬†than for China.

Will China take a risk and militarily restore control over Taiwan? It is hard to predict, though if it doesn‚Äôt do that now, it is unlikely that Taiwan will ever be Chinese again.

What are China‚Äôs non-military options? China might consider imposing a partial or fulscale ban on trade with Taiwan, which is majorly dependent on China, and encircling it in the ring of the blockade. At least the map of the military drills gives such a perception. 

No matter the further moves of Beijing, the US will continue playing with fire. And what is really definite¬†is what Xi Jinping said to Biden in their latest phone call:¬†""Those who play with fire will eventually get¬†burned.""",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,8421.0,36.0,,,,[],,MessageMediaWebPage,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityTextUrl,0.0,1.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,109.0,46.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,1968.0,22.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,2037.0,49.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,2551.0,29.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,3556.0,54.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,3784.0,51.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,101.0,,,,,,,,MessageReplies,0.0,25478.0,False,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WebPage,5.081221151880889e+18,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1726574262.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Then, since May 18, the AFU has been firing these mines into settlements not only of the DPR, but also into the liberated territory of the Kharkov region.

Since July 27, Ukrainian war criminals have been launching similar missiles equipped with prohibited ‚ÄúLepestok‚Äù mines on the most densely populated neighborhoods of Donetsk.

As of August 2, locations in Voroshilovsky, Kievsky, Kuibyshevsky, Kirovsky, Petrovsky, Kalininsky districts of Donetsk are mined. On July 29, prohibited ‚ÄúLepestok‚Äù mines were found in the village of Panteleimonovka, as well as in Makeevka.

According to the expert assessment of the DPR Ministry of Emergency Situations, Ukrainian criminals scattered several thousand prohibited mines in Donetsk alone. This assessment is based on the main method of mining with the help of the MLRS ‚ÄúUragan‚Äù, the rocket of which contains 12 mine distribution canisters with 320 anti-personnel mines of the ‚ÄúLepestok‚Äù  PFM, the use of which has been repeatedly recorded by the DPR Representative Office in the JCCC.

An interesting investigation here by RT

The Ukrainian operation to steal a Russian military aircraft, thwarted by the FSB, was supervised, among other things, by British intelligence. This was told by the pilots who were trying to recruit.

Representatives of the Ukrainian special services offered them $2 million for the hijacking, as well as European passports for them and their families.

In order to gain the trust of Russians, Ukrainians shared information that they were not allowed to disclose. They asked the pilots to shoot a video next to specific aircraft (they wanted to make sure that those really have access to equipment).

For these shots, they also promised a reward, which was handed over by couriers ‚Äî recruited girls. Later it turned out that Christo Grozev, the Bellingcat employee, was also connected with the Ukrainian special services.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,54181.0,317.0,,,,[],,MessageMediaDocument,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,MessageEntityTextUrl,190.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,517.0,,,,,,,,MessageReplies,0.0,25478.0,False,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Document,5.399913341600668e+18,2.951989891142725e+18,"[2, 97, 189, 237, 15, 0, 0, 18, 165, 99, 245, 147, 139, 216, 246, 214, 42, 178, 119, 105, 91, 106, 220, 159, 115, 203, 166, 108, 187]",2022-07-25T07:51:04+00:00,video/mp4,99550170.0,2.0,,,,,PeerChannel,1419769554.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PhotoStrippedSize,i,"[1, 22, 40, 132, 62, 20, 212, 145, 75, 207, 90, 168, 28, 114, 13, 62, 50, 185, 192, 207, 52, 132, 79, 230, 225, 152, 231, 145, 218, 144, 73, 147, 86, 35, 17, 152, 247, 28, 99, 169, 170, 76, 248, 115, 128, 125, 120, 161, 171, 21, 185, 56, 152, 115, 142, 212, 85, 108, 238, 36, 246, 162, 149, 196, 209, 6, 224, 58, 174, 127, 26, 151, 116, 96, 3, 131, 159, 243, 239, 69, 20, 192, 112, 187, 80, 49, 131, 249, 127, 245, 233, 190, 98, 28, 147, 187, 39, 175, 249, 205, 20, 80, 52, 49, 159, 0, 237, 24, 252, 104, 162, 138, 0]",,,,DocumentAttributeVideo,612.0,1920.0,1080.0,,True,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Des technologies sans fil, des applications t√©l√©phoniques, et les radars GPS leur permettent de d√©tecter leurs cibles et de diriger ces faisceaux √† distance sans que personne ne puisse les voir. C‚Äôest une ""guerre"" cach√©e et qui se produit sous les yeux de tous. Les victimes souffrent atrocement en silence parce que leurs plaies sont quasi invisibles, √† l‚Äôext√©rieur du corps, et que la population n'est pas sensibilis√©e √† ces technologies. Les tortionnaires en profitent donc pour les faire passer pour folles.

Sachons qu‚Äôune personne attaqu√©e par ces armes peut se plaindre principalement des sympt√¥mes suivants :

1. Secousses dans les diff√©rents membres du corps
2. Sensations de br√ªlures diffuses ou localis√©es intenses

Cybertorture / Gangs Stalking 

Pour augmenter l‚Äô√©tendue des dommages et leur destruction, ils enseignent les usages de leurs armes de torture aux membres du crime organis√© ou des gangs de rue, qui, eux, r√©alisent leurs prescriptions le plus souvent sous hypnose ou contrainte. Des jeux vid√©os de torture du genre ¬´ TortureWare v.6 ¬ª sont utilis√©s. On leur fait croire que les individus qu‚Äôils torturent dans le jeu ne souffrent pas.

Un cas int√©ressant est celui des femmes anglaises qui ont √©t√© expos√©es √† ces rayons lorsqu‚Äôelles manifestaient contre les armes nucl√©aires et les cons√©quences des d√©chets en Angleterre. Dans son article sur ¬´Les armes psychotroniques¬ª, Joe Vials d√©crit certains pr√©judices caus√©s par ces armes √©lectroniques :

1 Cycles mensuels irr√©guliers
2 Avortements
3 Probl√®mes gyn√©cologiques
4 Br√ªlures de la r√©tine
5 Probl√®mes auditifs
6 Tumeurs de croissance rapide
7 Dysfonctionnement multiple des organes

Wir erleben momentan die wahrscheinlich gr√∂√üte V√∂lkerwanderung in der Geschichte der Menschheit. 

Gem√§ss UNO (welche das Chaos verursachen) sind es √ºber 100'000'000 = 100 Millionen Menschen welche nach einer neuen Heimat unterwegs sind. 

√úbrigens, auch wenn es einige nicht gerne lesen - 100'000'000 = 100 Millionen Menschen sind so viele Morde wie jedes Jahr von Frauen in Auftrag gegeben werden. Diese Morde werden dann zynisch und verharmlosend einfach Abtreibungen genannt.

Hier sehen wir Bilder vor den Toren der europ√§ischen Grenze in Melilla, auf spanischem Territorium. Die Menschen kehren nat√ºrlich nicht um, sondern versuchen wenn es sein muss sogar mit Gewalt nach Europa zu kommen. 

Das Resultat sind Mord und Totschlag. Die Ursachen hierf√ºr werden von unseren Medien schlichtweg ignoriert und durch eine Willkommenskultur ersetzt. 

Dahinter steckt ein satanischer Plan von Chaos und Zerst√∂rung, der Destabilisierung Europas und der V√∂lkervermischung. 

Es ist eine von vielen Etappen der NWO-Agenda auf dem Weg in die kommunistische Menschenvieh-Haltung.

The font is apparently meant to represent Old German which was commonly used in germany in the times of the german empire and also when the ns were in power. 
And i can also read and write in old german.
The closest I can come is ""Arbeit adelt."" And that would mean in english translated: Work ennobles.

Edit : ok, so i got it. It really should read ""Arbeit adelt"". Here is some history to this phrase : There was a Reichsarbeitsdienst (Reich Labor Service) during the time of the third reich in germany. 
The Reich Labour Service (Reichsarbeitsdienst; RAD) was a major organisation established in Nazi Germany as an agency to help mitigate the effects of unemployment on the German economy, militarise the workforce and indoctrinate it with Nazi ideology. 
It was the official state labour service, divided into separate sections for men and women.

From June 1935 onward, men aged between 18 and 25 may have served six months before their military service. During World War II, compulsory service also included young women and the RAD developed to an auxiliary formation which provided support for the Wehrmacht armed forces.
The ""F√ºhrer"" ( Leaders) got a ""Haumesser""  (Shark Knife / Slasher) to their own Possession.
This blade looks like that one in the video.

That blade in the video is a replica of the ""Haumesser"" of this Leader of the ""Reich Labor Service"" during the third reich.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,2022-06-30T18:57:31+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReplyHeader,3523.0,,3507.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""ARGUS-S"" belongs to Ukrainian oligarch Plakhotniuk, who is now hiding in Turkey and has been repeatedly accused of smuggling weapons to pro-Turkish militants and even ISIS terrorists.
After the start of the conflict, militants in Idlib started to show off with Western weapons, including Javelin ATGMs and the Belgian SCAR-L rifle.

A quick reminder, one of the pillars of the Ukrainain propaganda was an ""Russian air strike"" on a maternity hospital in Mariupol. However, the women in labor themselves denied this. They said that the explosion was carried out by Ukrainian soldiers near the hospital, there were also professional photographers for the Western media there, just by coincidence.

Furthermore, these lies was spread around the world to justify sanctions and threats against Russia, as well as incite hatred against Russia.

What will happen to NATO's Turkey now? Will Syrian flags fly all around the globe? Will there be breaking news and damnatory news headings? Will there be ""sanctions from hell""?

Hello, Poles! And you were complaining about 'Russian occupation' üòÇ! I believe never in Polish history - neither when much of Poland was part of Russia - (congress) Kingdom of Poland - nor during the Warsaw pact, could Russia boast such an amount of military bases, facilities, even simple barracks in Poland.

What a shame, what a disgrace, their country is literally occupied completely and they are proud of that. They also constantly show up as 'the most russophobic nation in the world' in many polls.

On April 16, a DPR officer was contacted by some people who offered him cooperation in exchange for cooperation. He was clearly given to understand that if there was no consent, anything could happen to his daughter.

After an investigation, it was established that there was no official arrest of Catherine. She was abducted with her husband by the special services of Ukraine and is now being held in one of the secret prisons. The only way to save the life of the girl and her husband is to bring this situation to the public plane, since such an action in any country in the world qualifies as kidnapping and illegal detention of people and is punishable.

Ukraine was fooled by the west, and then thorn apart by Russia and the West. It should have kept its neutral status. But we must not forget ukrainian troops joined the invasions of Afghan and Iraq. So they are not neutral from 2001. Legally a new president came in 2010 who said we are not going to join nato, and shit started. Main reasons is Nato expansion to the east and destroying russia army so it cant block their future plans like in Syria or Lybia. And if you really think Nato cares about independence or about Ukraine, respecting borders this is really funny. People of Ukraine are not to be blamed, they were fooled by having to pick side Russia or Nato, and they should have not picked anybody. So this is not Ukraine- Russia war, it is Nato- Russia war. Nato weapons, nato instructors but ukrainian cannon meat. All this is fault of politicans of Ukraine, pro-russians ones who stole so much, and pro-western ones who wanted to put a nation who is devided in military alliance who exist only to fight Russia.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,2022-05-24T17:04:45+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,True,,,,,,,,,,MessageReplyHeader,1538.0,,1507.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessagePeerReaction,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerUser,153372628.0,ReactionEmoji,üëç,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Let me remind you that robbery is defined as a war crime in the report of the Commission on Responsibility established after the First World War, as well as in the Statute of the International Military Tribunal (Nuremberg), established after the Second World War. The Fourth Geneva Convention also prohibits robbery.

According to the Statute of the International Criminal Court, ""the looting of a city or town, even if it is captured by storm,"" is a war crime during international armed conflicts.

The prohibition of robbery is enshrined in many military regulations and manuals. Robbery is a crime under the laws of many states. This prohibition was applied in a number of cases tried in national courts after the Second World War.

Robbery is also a crime during non-international armed conflicts when it comes to domestic violence. For example, in its decision on the Military Junta case in 1985, the National Court of Appeal of Argentina applied the rule on the prohibition of robbery contained in the Hague Regulations to the actions committed in a situation of domestic violence.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,12446.0,28.0,2022-05-16T09:16:01+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,129.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,129.0,,,,,MessageReplies,8.0,25478.0,False,[],,2515.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Putin only lets government controlled journalists investigate with a script and arrest them if they are honest. 

Putin is not cooperating with UN, AMNESTY, RED CROSS or any international instances that can help and are trying to solve the issue and help protect civilians. If you would let them in safely to investigate instead of lying about their intentions and only let russian controlled instances help. Then I can promise that those alleged war crimes committed by Ukraine or anyone, if there is real proof, will be brought to justice. If you would only cooperate and stop giving demands that are illogical and impossible to solve. Like, saying Ukraine are nazis when their president is Jewish. There are nazis in Ukraine, but not enough to send 100 000 troops into Ukraine, to loose and retreat and changing plans, those are not nazis pushing you back. They are defenders of their land, your brothers and sisters that you are killing. All they want is to be left in peace and not die. 

You also say that russians has not killed any civilians, right? 
It is logically impossible to not atleast accidentally kill or hurt any civilians in this kind of terrorbombing war or basically any war. 100 000+ russian soildiers with mortar aimed toward resident houses has not killed any civilians? Impossible! 

You can't say ""Ukrainian soldiers are hiding there"", bcs if thats the case, you just don't fkng shoot there!!! 
You find another way to avoid risk killing hundreds of innocent civilians! 

Ukraine has evidence of cooperating with UN, world leaders and other instances that has visited Kiev and Bucha among other attacked places where there is physical evidence of terrorism and genocide comitted by russian soldiers. Even proved to be honest confessions by russian soldiers that gave up rather then terrorizing or retreating to a bullet in the head from his own troops. You can't deny these facts! Ukraine also admits to accidentally killing civilians and they let ICJ investigate evident war crimes comitted by Ukrainian soildiers. They will be prosecuted if there is proof, it takes years to investige.

I won't say that all Ukrainians were particularly concerned with peace or preservation of life. And not just Azov, Aiden and Right Sector either. 

Even if everything halted, and and all was perfect - Russia Will hundred of billions of dollars of rebuilding to undertake. And each day NATO says more, it's not us who suffers, it's the very people they've professed to want to save.

Sounds foolish to me, then again the first couple weeks, surely the Baltics we're next ü§≠ as if - nothing but heartfelt condolences for those who remained - Estonia bands letters, Lithuania will pass on remembering anything about her pre-Soviet days and for a country that tried to abolish Russian, it sure has come in handy in both Latvia and Lithuania as they do their part in handing their part of their mess.

America is no longer as tempting a place of residence for the world‚Äôs wealthy as it was before the Covid-19 pandemic, a newly¬†released¬†Wealth Report by London-based immigration consultancy Henley & Partners has found.

According to the report, inflows of high-net-worth individuals in the country dropped more than 80% last year compared with pre-pandemic levels. The figure fell to just 1,500 millionaires in 2022, from up to 10,800 between 2013 and 2019. The report states that ‚Äúthe country is losing its luster among migrating millionaires"" and ""the ‚ÄòAmerican Dream‚Äô is now on life-support.‚Äù

The report also noted that the countries where the newcomers originate have changed. While previously, most applicants for investment migration programs were from ‚Äúdeveloping nations who had weak passports, with limited visa-free access and low economic mobility,‚Äù most current newcomers are now from developed countries.

‚¨õÔ∏è Americans are more interested in circumventing laws lately. 

‚¨õÔ∏è The cultural shift from guns as hunting to guns as tools to fight with, has data supporting it. 

Trends to look for: 
Wyoming (Pop 500k) has 2k machineguns, 16k silencers, 2.1k short barreled rifles. Conscripting 20k Wyomingites out of a population of 500k gives 4% by manpower. Tennessee (Pop 6.9mil) has 0.5mil silencers. And we are only looking into people crazy enough to file all this paperwork.

Edit - Anon: Add ""solvent trap"" google searches trends to your American gun analysis. Solvent traps are the p80s of Silencers.

To be fair, Wyoming has highest NFA ownership per capita. If Americans from other states were as armed as high tier gun owners on paper from wyoming, a general population of 83 million would already have a 3.3 million man army. In essence, larger than China's PLA.

A rising middle class, relative area stability and security, foreign investment, competitive countries with productive and competitive manufacturing, modern infrastructures‚Ä¶ 

Lot of assets allowing to grow steadily.

Then if you are English speaker, I think learning Asian languages is a real investment which at the end will not give you a lot of benefits. Because in China each province as its own dialect.

If you learn Mandarin you might be able to speak Chinese in an official way and read the newspapers, watch TV.

The end of the Second World War and the defeat of Ukrainian Nazi collaborators did not end the nationalist movement in the Soviet republic. On the contrary, realizing the futility of underground armed struggle, the ""patriots"" took the opposite approach.

Political journalist Alexander Nepogodin explains how Ukrainian Nazis attempted to gain their so-called independence.

Message,103194,1731758208,,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"Individual income taxes is one thing let‚Äôs actually list what they did in Kansas shall we 
The Kansas tax plan collapsed the state‚Äôs three individual marginal income tax rates of 3.5, 6.25, and 6.45 percent down to two rates of 3.0 and 4.9 percent.6 In a similar fashion, the Trump-McConnell-Ryan tax plan would collapse the number of individual brackets from seven down to three, with rates of 12, 25, and 35 percent‚Äîwith a possible fourth bracket between 35 and 39.6 percent.7 These changes both reduce the progressivity of the respective tax codes and give the biggest benefit to those with the highest income.
A key feature of the 2012 Kansas tax plan was its elimination of taxes on pass-through business income. Pass-throughs are businesses‚Äîsuch as sole proprietorships, S corporations, partnerships, and limited liability companies (LLCs)‚Äîthat do not pay the corporate income tax. Their income is passed through to the owners and taxed at their individual tax rates. Together with the lower marginal tax rates also enacted in Kansas that year, this created a 4.6 percent difference between the tax treatment of business income, now taxed at a zero rate, and that of other individual income, taxed at a top rate of 4.9 percent. Recent analysis has shown that this differential overwhelmingly caused tax avoidance rather than economic growth, with many individuals recharacterizing their personal income as business income in order to take advantage of the zero tax rate rather than increasing real business activity.8 Kansas had estimated that about 200,000 pass-through businesses would use the pass-through tax break, but about 330,000 actually used it.9
The Kansas plan included selected tax cuts for low- and middle-income families, such as an increased standard deduction, that nevertheless were estimated to leave many of those families with tax increases.11 In a very similar manner, the Unified Framework would increase the standard deduction and possibly the child tax credit but would take away personal and dependent exemptions as well as other tax benefits, leaving many low- and middle-income families with a tax increase.12
After the Brownback tax cuts, instead of a booming economy, Kansas residents witnessed a sharp decline in state revenues, sluggish growth, and brutal cuts to government programs.18 Indeed, between 2013 and 2016, Kansas‚Äô real gross domestic product only grew by 3.8 percent, while national GDP growth was nearly double that at 7 percent.19
Employment growth in Kansas has also lagged far behind the rest of the nation. Since the tax cuts took effect in 2013, total employment rose just 2.6 percent, compared with the 6.5 percent average increase experienced by the rest of the nation. And the story for private sector employment was similar, with Kansas‚Äô 3.5 percent growth falling far behind the national growth rate of 7.6 percent.
In the following five years,‚Äù Dinah Sykes explained in a message to the U.S. Congress, ‚ÄúKansas experienced nine rounds of budget cuts, stress on state agencies and the inability to effectively provide the core functions of government for our citizens.‚Äù21
As a result of the 2012 tax cuts, revenues plummeted and the state general fund debt load more than doubled from its 2010 level, leading both Moody‚Äôs Investors Service and Standard & Poor‚Äôs 500 Index to downgrade the state‚Äôs credit rating twice.22 After several years of draining the state reserves of cash, diverting funds from roads, delaying payments from pension funds, and reducing spending on critical programs such as Medicaid, housing, public safety, and education, the state government still began 2017 with a $350 million deficit.23

Another scary thought for your convo man, is look at tech. In 100 years we have become drastically more advanced. Now apply that to space travel. If in 100 years a species tech can drastically boom, then interstellar warfare suggests that first contact wars are the way to go. If you send a fleet and it takes 100 years to reach their system, they might be 100 years more advanced while you are 100 years behind in your own tech.

Basically he made many verifiably false statements and is not credible at all.

A non-revisionist historian has stated that

""When I have suggested to my colleagues that we must take seriously Eichmann's repeated testimony to the effect that he learned from Heydrich in the fall of 1941 of Hitler's order for the physical destruction of the Jews, I have met with either embarrassed silence or open skepticism. How can I be so gullible? Don't I know that Eichmann's testimony is a useless conglomeration of faulty memories on the one hand and calculated lies for legal defense and self-justification on the other? From it we can learn nothing of value about what actually happened during the war, only about Eichmann's state of mind after the war. These are documents that reveal how Eichmann wished to be remembered, not what he did.""[3]
Another example of non-revisionists declaring statements by Eichmann to not be credible is that

In his precapture statements, Eichmann claimed that he saw the alleged homicidal gas chambers of Majdanek, a concentration camp in Poland. Browning informed his readers in 2003 that these ‚Äúobservations‚Äù are not credible: ‚ÄúIn both precapture accounts, Eichmann‚Äôs dating is vague. Furthermore, the claims that gassing was already taking place in this first camp, or that it was Majdanek, are contrary to what we know from other sources. The precapture testimonies, in short, are helpful to neither the historian nor Eichmann‚Äôs credibility [p. 23].‚Äù In plain language, Eichmann never saw the ‚Äúgas chambers‚Äù he claimed to have seen at Majdanek.
Yet, how many millions of people were convinced of the ‚Äúexistence‚Äù of ‚Äúhomicidal gas chambers‚Äù after they read this untrue statement from Eichmann‚Äôs testimonials that appeared in the November 28 1960, issue of the immensely influential Life magazine. The Eichmann memoirs falsely declared: ‚ÄúIt was the latter part of 1941 that I saw the first preparations for annihilating the Jews. General Heydrich ordered me to visit Maidanek [sic], a Polish village near Lublin. A German police captain showed me how they had managed to build airtight chambers disguised as ordinary Polish farmers‚Äô huts, seal them hermetically, then inject the exhaust gas from a Russian U-boat motor.

The monthly ""profits"" of the organizers of illegal business amounted to more than UAH 50 million.

As a result of investigative and operational actions, SSU officers detained the deputy head of the Migration Police Department, the head of the department of the specialized unit of the Metropolitan Police and twelve other members of the group, including two citizens of russia. According to the investigation, the officials covered up the activities of an extensive network of places of debauchery in Kyiv.

Girls aged 18 to 30 with a vulnerable psycho-emotional state were selected for such ""facilities"". In addition, they created a network of specialized groups in messengers, in which ""administrators"" looked for female citizens to provide intimate services for money, including ""escorts"". The pimps offered them ""trips"" to clients in various regions of Ukraine, and also sent them abroad. The cost of ""services"" ranged from $500 to $10000 for the night.

As part of the criminal proceedings, the employees of the Security Service conducted more than 30 searches at the addresses of the suspects, in particular, in the administrative buildings of the National Police of Ukraine. Based on the collected evidence, more than 20 persons were notified of suspicion under three articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine:
‚ñ™Ô∏è Art.  255 (creation, management of a criminal community or criminal organization);
‚ñ™Ô∏è Art.  302 (creating or maintaining places of debauchery);

The Korean Active Protection System (KAPS) is an indigenously developed hard-kill active protection system designed to protect the K2 from anti-tank threats. It uses a three-dimensional detection and tracking radar and a thermal imager to detect incoming threats.[84][85][86] Warheads can be detected out to 150 meters from the tank, and a defensive rocket is fired to destroy them at 10‚Äì15 meters away.[87][88]

The system can neutralize rocket-propelled grenades and anti-tank guided missiles. It may be installed on other platforms in the future like warships, helicopters, and buildings. Unit price per system is ‚Ç©670 million ($600,000).[89] Implementation of the KAPS was cancelled in 2014 due to budgetary issues along with the price of a K2 being at 8 billion won, with addition of the KAPS it would increase procurement costs by 1 billion won per unit.[90] """,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReplyHeader,72128.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-ukrainewarchatroom_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Message,44496,1731758208,,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"Eratosthenes‚Äô most famous accomplishment is his measurement of the circumference of Earth. He recorded the details of this measurement in a manuscript that is now lost, but his technique has been described by other Greek historians and writers.

Eratosthenes was fascinated with geography and planned to make a map of the entire world. He realized he needed to know the size of Earth. Obviously, one couldn‚Äôt walk all the way around to figure it out.

Eratosthenes had heard from travelers about a well in Syene (now Aswan, Egypt) with an interesting property: at noon on the summer solstice, which occurs about June 21 every year, the sun illuminated the entire bottom of this well, without casting any shadows, indicating that the sun was directly overhead. Eratosthenes then measured the angle of a shadow cast by a stick at noon on the summer solstice in Alexandria, and found it made an angle of about 7.2 degrees, or about 1/50 of a complete circle.

He realized that if he knew the distance from Alexandria to Syene, he could easily calculate the circumference of Earth. But in those days it was extremely difficult to determine distance with any accuracy. Some distances between cities were measured by the time it took a camel caravan to travel from one city to the other. But camels have a tendency to wander and to walk at varying speeds. So Eratosthenes hired bematists, professional surveyors trained to walk with equal length steps. They found that Syene lies about 5000 stadia from Alexandria.

Eratosthenes then used this to calculate the circumference of the Earth to be about 250,000 stadia. Modern scholars disagree about the length of the stadium used by Eratosthenes. Values between 500 and about 600 feet have been suggested, putting Eratosthenes‚Äô calculated circumference between about 24,000 miles and about 29,000 miles. The Earth is now known to measure about 24,900 miles around the equator, slightly less around the poles.

Eratosthenes had made the assumption that the sun was so far away that its rays were essentially parallel, that Alexandria is due north of Syene, and that Syene is exactly on the tropic of cancer. While not exactly correct, these assumptions are good enough to make a quite accurate measurement using Eratosthenes‚Äô method. His basic method is sound, and is even used by schoolchildren around the world today.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,2023-01-09T14:26:22+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReplies,0.0,140611.0,False,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessagePeerReaction,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerUser,5360141048.0,ReactionEmoji,üëç,,,,csv/original/Channel-ukrainewarchatroom_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Russia cannot build its own country. why should it build Ukraine?

History shows that Russia does not do this, otherwise the country would be rich today. the Europeans have no natural resources and still have strong economies. why can't Russia do that despite the gift of many raw materials?

simply. it has no interest in it. just look at Germany. FRG and GDR.

Germany was rich because the allies invested. especially the usa after the war. brd got rich. brd had no debts in 1990.

the 2.5 trillion debts that Germany has are because of the GDR. Although so much has been invested in the former GDR, the standard of living in western Germany is higher.

Russia left the GDR in a catastrophic state.

History shows exactly that Russia does not act that way. moscow, saint petersberg... getting richer. the rest remain poor. here is only exploited not built.

history doesn't lie. that's how it happened.

I say if Ukraine loses the war then it will be a very poor country in 50 years under the control of Russia.

‚ÄºÔ∏è More precisely, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are defending Ukrainian soil. While 20,000 Russian convicts have already gone to ""Putin's paradise,"" and the rest are waiting for the same fate solely because of the billions of dollars that Prigozhin wants to dig out of the Ukrainian soil. The ""Bakhmut case"" is absolutely reminiscent of Wagner's African wanderings, with one difference: in Ukraine, a private terrorist company is directly ""backed"" by the Russian state.

The ""cook"" of the F√ºhrer's supreme commander-in-chief seeks to seize the salt and plaster mines near Bakhmut.

üëâ Prigozhin's ""obsession"" with Bakhmut is driven by monetary motives, claims an unnamed American official quoted by Reuters.

üëâ Near Bakhmut is Europe's largest salt deposit, with an area of 179 square kilometers. It has salt reserves of 15,648 million tons.

üëâ On the territory of Bakhmut there are unique deposits of refractory clays and pure gypsum, which were hunted for by most of the world's famous producers of building mixes.

üëâ The profitability from the development of these deposits amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars per year.¬† 

üëâ Wagner is a kind of modern Company with a bias towards the mining industry. Self-sufficient structure with its own army, which promotes the geopolitical interests of the Kremlin in Africa. PMC Wagner has actually created their own economy, based on the looting of natural resources of the black continent.

üëâ In the Central African Republic, the Wagnerites mines gold and diamonds through the company Lobaye Invest, registered in the country. Prigozhin also monopolized the diamond market, forcing all diggers to sell stones to his own company Diamville.

üëâ Two of Prigozhin's gold mining companies, Meroe Gold and M Invest, operate in Sudan. The Wagners also ""cover"" the activities of Gazprombank's company Alliance for Mining Co. LTD. According to Sudanese and Western sources, 70% of all gold mined by Russians is smuggled out via the United Arab Emirates. The Russians are also looking for uranium in Sudan.

In Madagascar, the Wagner's Ferrum Mining got access to deposits of gold, cobalt and uranium.¬† In Burkina Faso, according to authorities in neighboring Ghana, Prigogine got a gold mine in the south of the country.¬† In Mali, according to Reuters, the Wagnerians get about $11 million in cash a year and own several mines. Obviously, we are talking about gold, which is rich in this country.¬† In Mozambique, the mercenaries are interested in ruby deposits.

""We are in 80 percent of the African countries. We own most of the minerals on the continent. We have a lot of illegal mines. We illegally mine 50% of Africa's gold and diamonds,"" Prigozhin ironically says.

His boast, though exaggerated, generally captures the essence of Wagner's activities in Africa. Under the pretext of helping in civil wars, Prigozhin's mercenaries have settled in about 15 countries on the continent. And they are not the only ones.

‚ÄºÔ∏è For them, the war in Ukraine is analogous to African looting, but under the direct protectorate of the Kremlin. The Russian authorities not only provide political cover for the terrorist unit, but also corral tens of thousands of worthless lives as cannon fodder. At the same time, a commercial interest is sacralized, protecting the interests of the ""empire.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,3347.0,13.0,,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,7312.0,,,,,,,,MessageReplies,0.0,140611.0,False,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1519483747.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-ukrainewarchatroom_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Afghanistan, Czech Republic, Georgia, Hungary,... the russians killed over 2 million civilians under the soviet flag.
the nazis were to blame for around 21 million civilian deaths and a total of 41 million victims in Europe.
Even if today one likes to compare Ukraine with the Second World War, it was a different dimension. back then, an average of 32,000 people died every day. i would say we live in a fairly peaceful world compared to the second world war. Despite all the wars and destruction in the Middle East and now the Ukraine war. Ukraine lost 8 million people during World War II. since the current war would have to last over 100 years to reach such numbers. the crimes of the nazis were worse compared to what is happening today.

but what bothers me is that you don't use the past to prevent wars, you use the past to start wars like putin does now. or as you say, victims of the past are no longer victims but perpetrators. I also don't understand that a people who experienced the holocaust now treat the people in Palestine like this.

But I would never let that get to me too much that I feel hate. Emotions are not a good advisor. Wars are started or waged because of emotions. Someone murders his ex-wife because of emotions...

what helps me not to feel hate and to look at it rationally is that all human beings are equal. we are a product of our environment. as an an example. no one is born in Russia who suddenly shouts: ""usa usa usa"" ü§£ if i was born in russia i would probably be a putin supporter now.

Of these, the Southern Crusades are far better known in the West, while the Northern Crusades, launched in 1147, are far less widely known. But they were kept going the longest‚Äîuntil February 22, 2022‚Äîbecause, unlike China, India and just about every other non-Western country, Russia has never surrendered to anyone.

The gauntlet was thrown down in 1252, when Alexander Nevsky accepted an official document, called yarlyk, from Khan Batyj of the Golden Horde (part of the Mongolian Empire), allowing him to reign as the Grand Prince of Kiev (and thus the ruler of all of Russia), rather than ask for a blessing from the Pope in Rome, as was required of all Western kings. To these Western potentates, their claim to be ordained by God was based on approval by His head office at the Vatican; to the Russians, the Pope was just some heretic usurper. The religious distinction played itself out over time, but the notion that there is an exclusive club of Western nations who deserve to wield authority over the rest of the world has remained to this day.

There followed a series of onslaughts on Russia spanning many centuries, all stemming from the same simple principle: that which the West cannot control must be destroyed. The Germans and the Swedes kept on attacking it until 1709. Then the French attacked again in 1812; and then the Germans in 1941. The Americans were poised to attack in March of 2022, via their Ukrainian/NATO proxies, but were preempted by Russia‚Äôs Special Military Operation. Thus, the last Crusade has been aborted and further attempts seem unlikely, since, at this point, there is no question of destroying that which the West cannot control, and not just Russia but also much of the rest of the world. Even tiny North Korea can stand up to the collective West and wag a finger in its face. The thousand-year show is nearly over.

Over the previous centuries, every time after Russia expelled yet another crusader, some other Western nations would take the lead and attempt to march on Moscow: it was the Germans (as the Teutonic Knights, then the Swedes, the Poles, then some more Swedes, then the French under Napoleon, then the Germans under Hitler, and now the Americans (disguised as some hapless, clueless Ukrainians) under Biden. (Yes, the last act of this drama is most definitely a farce.) But who could possibly rise up as the next crusader du Jour? Nobody! There isn‚Äôt anyone left in the West to continue the project. https://cluborlov.wordpress.com/2022/12/30/the-last-crusade-part-ii/",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,64269.0,982.0,2023-01-02T05:23:34+00:00,,,[],,MessageMediaWebPage,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,298.0,MessageEntityBold,510.0,106.0,MessageEntityBold,1357.0,803.0,MessageEntityBold,2630.0,129.0,MessageEntityUrl,2761.0,68.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,True,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,31690.0,,,,,,,,MessageReplies,2.0,140611.0,False,[],,35488.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WebPage,5.420997353763849e+18,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1391166244.0,,,,,,,,,,,MessagePeerReaction,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerUser,5691316739.0,ReactionEmoji,üëç,,,,csv/original/Channel-ukrainewarchatroom_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1. ""The Great War is back"", countries must now responsibly manage their industrial capacity and huge stockpiles of weapons.

2. ""Strategic depth"" of arms deliveries. Ukraine has already received more than $40 billion in military aid.

3. Quality is more important than quantity. Logistics, troops, and equipment are useless if intelligence and command are weak or inadequate.

almost all want to help Ukraine humanitarian. Germany has now taken in almost as many Ukrainians as Poland. over 1 million who are integrated into the social system.

for me this is incomprehensible. But it's probably because I'm so young. This spare of Russia. this reserved behavior towards Putin has to do with the Second World War. For decades, Germany was blamed for the Second World War. Poland demands 1.2 trillion World War reparations this year. When German politicians travel to Poland or other countries that suffered under the Nazis, one always hears this apology for the crimes of the Second World War in speeches...

Soviet Union had 27 million casualties through WWII because of the Nazis. In Germany, the Soviet Union is often equated with Russia.

Now one wonders why one should suddenly forget these 27 million victims in the Soviet Union.

Recently, for example, I wrote on YouTube with an American about the Iraq war. there he arrives directly with the World War club. As a German, I should better shut up about the history...

here the politicians definitely failed to enlighten the people. but is certainly due to scholz spd. the spd really suffered under hitler and was liberated by the soviet union.

This is something else that is not expensive that can easily be sent to the front.  The empty 2L bottles are found all over the world.   They don‚Äôt need to be clean, you are putting puddle water in them.

Message,11152,1731758208,,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"THREAD : To win the war change in all areas of life. This is generally clear to everyone. But one of the most important ideas eludes many. We must stop thinking in terms of good-bad and good-evil and start thinking only about what leads to victory. If an evil and immoral act brings victory closer, then this is the right act.

Humane good people will never win a war. They can only ruin the lives of millions of their people instead of destroying the enemy by any effective means. The key word here is efficiency. If some action is so cruel and obvious that it does not cause fear in the enemy, but only more bitterness, then such an action is not necessary. But at the same time, if even the most immoral of all measures turns out to be effective, it should become the main one for the one who is going to win.

Enough humanism and compassion!
We must bring suffering to the enemy!

Don't worry about public opinion: the propaganda of the enemy will always invent twenty times as much anyway. And our own propaganda will make people think that all this is fake. As for the international community, there are no comments here: only a degenerate seriously thinks that our enemies or allies care about all these stories. Their position will remain unchanged in any case.

Conclusion: you need to apply any methods without regard to someone else's opinion.

There is only one war crime in war - defeat. There are no other war crimes. Winners are not judged. But woe to the vanquished: if we lose, then there will certainly be crimes for a show trial, in extreme cases they will simply be invented. Since it was promoted after the Second World War (((Holocaust))), then why not invent a ukrainocaust, for example? Propaganda will make you believe in anything. Moreover, the losing side is always blamed for the victor's crimes.

The fourth Saturday of November is the holodomor remembrance, known as the terror famine happened on the occupied territories of Ukraine in 1932 and 1933

At the hands of Judeo-soviets, an estimated 6-12 million white Ukrainians were systematically starved to death, the biggest genocide of our race.

Still to this day this terrible tragedy is barely recognised and swept under the carpet

  Russian President Vladimir Putin, in addition to launching regional turkey breeding centers, together with his ‚Äúsuccessor‚Äù Dmitry Patrushev, also holds closed meetings where he discusses topics that are really important for the country.  Yesterday, during a meeting with representatives of the leadership of the power and military blocs, Putin discussed news from the front and, as a result, mobilization and the declaration of martial law.  Putin is being reported on the difficult situation along the entire front line.  In addition to problems with the equipment, weapons and motivation of the mobilized, significant problems arose with the arrival of cold weather in the form of a sharp increase in colds, viral and bacterial diseases.  No one makes any indulgence to sick servicemen, up to severe conditions, which affects the effectiveness of combat missions.  The number of recorded frostbites among military personnel in the combat zone has increased.  This is superimposed on supply problems, the practical absence of medicines and the ability to promptly provide medical care.  Against this background, Putin said that he was convinced of the need for a full-fledged mobilization.  Now, in his opinion, the second wave of partial mobilization will not solve anything, and it will be like ""cutting the tail of a dog in parts.""  The President expressed the opinion that mobilization is necessary and it is only necessary to think about how to announce it and, most importantly, to carry it out most effectively and without excesses, taking into account the experience of partial mobilization.  Putin considers it ‚Äúsufficient‚Äù to call up another 2 million people, of which about 300,000 are women.  The meeting participants supported the president without much enthusiasm.  Representatives of the leadership of the military bloc confirmed the possibility and readiness to conduct mobilization starting from January 2023.  Putin shared the idea proposed by Sergei Kiriyenko - to call, as part of the mobilization, for the most part, people with Ukrainian surnames, they say, let the Ukrainians destroy each other.  A spokesman for the Defense Department said that it would be difficult to implement such a decision ""invisibly"" and that preliminary preparations would have to be made.  Further, the problematic subjects of the Russian Federation were discussed, in which there were unrest during partial mobilization, and the participants of the meeting, including the president, recognized as correct the ‚Äúminimal‚Äù mobilization plans for these territories in the future.  Regarding the martial law, Putin said that he considered it necessary not to limit himself this time to ‚Äúhalf measures‚Äù, but along with the mobilization, to declare martial law throughout the country, or at least in most of the territory of Russia. 
 ""People's war"", when ""everything for the front, everything for victory"", is now the main topic of discussions between Putin and his entourage.  A large number of victims among those mobilized, according to the president, will only rally Russian society and strengthen the current regime, and regardless of whether the result will be victory or defeat.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,7944.0,22.0,2022-11-22T16:21:33+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,True,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,214.0,,,,,,,,MessageReplies,0.0,140611.0,False,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1779536240.0,,,,,,,,,,,MessagePeerReaction,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerUser,5413983249.0,ReactionEmoji,üëç,,,,csv/original/Channel-ukrainewarchatroom_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Message,1814,1731758208,,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"Reza Shah founded modern Iran. He modernized the country and did a lot of service to this country. People respect him to this day. Although Iran declared neutrality in World War II, the allied forces invaded the country from multiple directions. because Iran was a major hub for transporting troops, ammo, etc. They removed him from power and exiled him to a remote island. They replaced him with his son, who was not popular like his father. But still, he too did a lot of service and was modernizing the country; however, in his later years of ruling, he sometimes got into issues with Western powers. He didn't want to be a puppet of the West and had some tendencies toward working with China and the USSR. Although Iran was not a democracy under the Shah, the living conditions were good. People had social freedoms, could earn a decent living, could travel to Europe without a visa (strong passport), etc. Because the West was afraid that communism would spread to the Middle East, they saw Mullahs as a viable alternative to Shah because religion is anti-communism. There are even correspondences between Carter and Khomeini. Khomeini promised Carter that he would not rule the country himself and that the new government would be pro-US, but he lied. So the West betrayed the Shah, although he was their ally in the Middle East. When we ask ordinary people the age of our fathers and grandfathers, why the revolution? They all say we don't know.

Then he tried to ""correct"" himself so as not to deviate from the Kremlin's playbook and began to blame Ukraine. 

But, of course, the whole world knows that the dead bodies of civilians on the streets of peaceful towns appear just after the arrival of the Russian army. That's it, not the other way round .

Message,1931,1610060648,,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"‚ö°Ô∏èAdviser to the Head of the Office of President of Ukraine Mykhailo Podolyak about the #bloodytrade: 

The heads of Danone, Nestle, Unilever and P&G have always preferred to use smiling children in their advertising campaigns. After all, this is the ideal target audience. Some sort of creation of the perfect illusion of family warmth. Right on the spot. The consumer is touched and buys the goods.

I think that now the advertising campaigns of these ""merchants of death"" should be based on black-and-white photos of dead Ukrainian children. A close-up. With all horrible details. With dead eyes. So that it would literally shock and forever burn into the memory of millions of consumers around the world. And with the appropriate slogans: ""You eat this bloody chocolate, so that the Russians can be happy to kill these Ukrainian children!""

So, from now on and forever, remember that all these vile brands deliberately, voluntarily, with great greed paid for the bloody war of the Russians against Ukraine. What has to be done? Everything is simple. 

First. Remember forever these names, which have become synonymous of evil. It is these companies that are now happily staying in Russia, paying taxes, supplying food there, and simply rejoicing that the Russians are using this money to brutally bomb our cities and kill our people.

Second. Systemic legal claims are needed in all jurisdictions against these cannibalistic firms that finance mass killings. 

Third. Protests are urgently needed in the countries / cities where these companies are headquartered. And there are offices of the CEOs fattening themselves on the suffering of innocent Ukrainians. They need to be walking around with the fear in their face, and their reputation must be ruined. 

We need to shake up these cynics. If  we don‚Äôt, there will be a lot of blood.

Europe has to wake up! The biggest nuclear power plant of the Europe is on fire. Right this moment. Russian tanks are firing at nuclear power blocks. They are equipped with thermal imagers. They know what they are firing at. They were getting ready for.

I'm reaching out to all Ukrainians, Europeans, people who knows word ""Chornobyl"". Who knows how much grief and sacrifice that explosion at the nuclear power plant brought in. It was a global catastrophe. 

Russia wants to repeat it and is acting on it now. But 6 times more. Europeans, wake up, please! NPP in Zaporizhya has 6 power blocks, there was one in Chornobyl that exploded.

We have contacted the leaders of other countries and our partners. There's no other country in the world, other than Russia, who fired weapons at nuclear power blocks ever. 

For the first time in mankind history terrorists country has used nuclear power terrorism.

""Cover the world in nuclear dust"" ‚Äî it's not just a threat from Russian Federation, it's a reality now. We have no idea what the fire at the NPP will result in.

Russian army needs to be stopped. Immediately alert your government, Ukraine has 15 nuclear power blocks. If there's an explosion, there will be end to all, end to Europe.

Putin is not invading Ukraine. 
Putin is taking out deep state black op bio labs with precision strikes, who have been trying to create killer diseases right on Russia's border. 
Ukraine is a stronghold for money laundering and the Biden crime family will be exposed with information coming out.  
This couldnt happen under Trump as its bad optics and the media love nothing more than to try to get Trump and Putin to fight.
Zelensky (a Ukrainian Trump who was elected) is in on this too, but will do the optics dance. 
Putin will come out with a peace deal soon. 
Those of us who do pay attention to what happens on our planet know that Putin is an enemy of the Globalists and is well aware of the Deep State presence in Ukraine. 
This all goes back to when the Neo Nazis took more control after the Maidan Square massacre about 8-9 years ago, where the deep state used snipers on roofs to wreak havoc. 
China will kick off with Taiwan next like Trump told us.
Like I have been saying all along Trump , Putin and Xi are covertly working together to take out the deep state cabal. 
You are watching a show. 
The MSM will hype this all up and make people believe that WW3 is imminent, which is complete fake news. 
The end result will be the exposing of the CIA's role in ""the virus"" as an attack on USA and China via Fauci leaked emails. 
This will expose the CIA's funding of the CCP, Big Pharma and to the normies, that yes there is such a thing as the cabal.
Xi is like a Trump, and is not an ally of the CCP. 
Xi was told not to bring Trump to the forbidden city when Trump visted but Xi did it anyway, which was such a huge deal as no one is allowed in the forbidden city , especially not someone from the West. 
The Chinese people will soon be free.  
This song and dance and show had to happen this way because your sheeple family and friends were too cowardly to wake up by themselves and refused to research or even question things even after the entire planet of healthy people were locked inside their homes because the media rebranded the flu and they were forced to get eperimental Big Pharma vaccines to live life, for the first time in history.
Our planet can never be allowed get this ignorant again. 
It is shameful , especially by the Western men whose chosen ignorance will be studied for eons.
God bless the Truth Bombers all around the world fighting for humanity. 
Our victory is inevitable.

Zaluzhnyi said Ukrainian forces had been able to¬†repel the breakthrough of Russian troops in the Chernihiv area north of the capital, Kyiv.
