IMF has stated that it has increased estimates of Russian economy growth from –2.3% contraction to 0.3% growth in 2023 despite a broad array of Western sanctions.

The IMF attributes this improvement to Russia finding new clients outside the West by redirecting trade from sanctioning to non-sanctioning countries. Activity of Russian defense industrial complex was one of the main contributors for projected growth.

These are good news, as we know that Western forecasts never favor Russia. Last year they forecasted collapse of Russian economy, then they stated that it will not return to growth until second half of 2020s, then it was 2024 and now it has already happened.

It looks like IMF reluctantly acknowledged amazingly quick recovery of Russian economy to add credibility to its other forecasts, such as the one concerning Europe. Yes, you heard it right, they forecast that European economy will grow in 2023. Despite it having far deeper problems than Russia. 

The thing is that Russia had to find customers for its export products, which are in very high demand. This was not really a problem as long as two thirds of the world didn’t join Western sanctions or simply ignored them. 

European problem is different, they need to find resources, especially energy. Amid looming energy crisis and soaring prices that are expected to come this year when Chinese reopening gains momentum, their chances to get a good deal are slim. 

For now, Europe is still living on Russian resources, despite all of their nice words. They are getting them from intermediary countries while some are coming directly from Russia. There is physically no way to replace Russian supplies and maintain European industry competitive, so all growth forecasts are likely to be artificial. 

There is a fundamental flaw in IMF estimations of economic growth. They estimate this growth in US dollars, and it is no longer a stable currency as it once used to be. 

Moreover, the rate of USD and EUR is greatly inflated and as these currencies are slowly but steadily losing relevance for international trade, estimates in these currencies are no longer objective. More objective are estimations based on purchasing power of currency and not on its market rate to USD. 

If we estimate things by purchasing power parity, we’ll see that Russian economy is actually twice stronger than it seems to the West, and so its growth is far better than anyone could guess. For reference, while market exchange rate is around $1 = 70 rubles, purchasing power rate is under 30 rubles per dollar.

Fortunately for Russia, dollar rate has little impact on its economy and influences only foreign trade. As Russia is readjusting its import-export flows, higher dollar rate means that Russia earns more money through export and can afford to import more goods, which translates into lower consumer prices. 

A fun fact, prices on modern notebooks in Russia fell by 25 percent since last October due to competition of parallel import and Chinese manufacturers trying to enter the lucrative Russian market. So, Russia is fine. Can’t say that of Europe.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,4223.0,5.0,2023-02-06T14:11:44+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,47.0,MessageEntityBold,211.0,251.0,MessageEntityBold,1501.0,170.0,MessageEntityBold,1827.0,167.0,MessageEntityBold,2617.0,102.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,567.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,567.0,,,,,MessageReplies,14.0,25478.0,False,[],,18084.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to Bloomberg, IMF is currently considering another $16 billion aid package for Ukraine.

The Fund's program will require fulfillment of a number of conditions, and the first disbursement may come as early as April.

Ukraine is already the third highest borrower of the IMF. Its debt has been mounting higher and higher for years, and in a few months after Russian SMO started the country got technically bankrupt. Ukraine’s creditors have suspended repayment until the end of this year, or else the country would have been unable to meet its obligations.

Maybe naïve Ukrainians keep thinking that someone will write off or cover their debts, but it is too much of wishful thinking. Money drives the West, and they are not a charity to give this money for free. So yes, future generations of Ukrainians will still pay. 

Meanwhile, the current government is enjoying its feast in the time of plague and is asking for more and more tools of war and money to pay its current bills. When a country cannot service its debt, it becomes dependent on its creditors, and Kiev regime turned Ukrainians into eternal serfs of the West.

One could compare Ukrainian elites with gamblers who have already lost everything and are now going deep in debts in desperate attempts to win something. While they really look this way, they are not so stupid. 

Zelensky and his team are just trying to drain as much money as they can from “Project Ukraine” to enjoy safe and comfortable retirement somewhere in Miami together with other former leaders of Maidan. 

Despite Zelensky playing role of a hero president, neither he nor anyone else can save Ukraine from military defeat and complete bankruptcy. It’s highly likely that Ukrainian government will completely change when Russia ends its special military operation, and it’s also highly likely that new Ukrainian government will face very hard choices with regard to debts made by Zelensky & Co. 

I don’t think that there is anyone left in Ukraine who believes fairly tales about EU entry “in just a couple years”, huge EU subsidies and life without poverty. Europe has its own problems and it’s more likely that in a couple years many Europeans will live like Ukrainians and not vice versa. 

So, this hypothetic future Ukrainian government will have only one way out of debt — pay it with assets, and land is the only liquid asset Ukraine has. West Ukraine will probably be enough, so this part of Ukraine will surely get to EU as a part of Poland… or maybe even Germany, who knows how things will change after a few more AFU defeats.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,4343.0,9.0,2023-02-02T13:02:18+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,2.0,49.0,MessageEntityItalic,114.0,11.0,MessageEntityBold,279.0,196.0,MessageEntityBold,825.0,55.0,MessageEntityBold,1747.0,245.0,MessageEntityBold,2302.0,141.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,565.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,565.0,,,,,MessageReplies,23.0,25478.0,False,[],,18051.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rasmus Paludan, leader of Danish far right movement Stram Kurs, threatened Erdogan with new performances like public burning of Quran last week and demanding change of Turkish stance on NATO membership for Sweden and Finland. 

In recent years far right parties have gained some momentum in Scandinavia, most notably in Sweden. 

Paludan’s movement does not enjoy popularity at home and that is the reason why he chose neighboring Sweden for his performances — Stockholm has more loyal audience. Populist right party “Swedish Democrats” is a part of the ruling coalition of Sweden and a large part of its members have strong anti-Muslim views. Sweden is becoming an arena of increasing ethnic and religious tensions, which resulted in increase of crime by 71 percent in last three years.

These acts infuriate all Muslims around the world, including Swedish Muslims that constitute almost 10 percent of population. While moderate Islam simply condemns such acts and revises its affiliations, radical Islamists may get engaged in some activity Sweden and the entire European Union. Offending religious feelings of 44 million Muslims living in European countries creates the environment for potential terrorist attacks.

What does it mean for Russia? We can view it as an unexpected gift. Outrage at Europe will bring the Arab world closer to Russian camp. Unlike Europeans, Russia does respect Muslim values and its considerable Muslim population enjoys full rights and respect in the society.

Turkey has already expressed its outrage about these performances and if someone thinks that desecration of Muslim holy book will push Erdogan to concessions, this someone is extremely wrong. 

Naturally, accepting the application of Sweden and its peer Finland to join NATO is now off the table. If Erdogan does win the coming elections in spring, Turkey may take further steps to distance from Europe and Ukraine. Some Turkish parliament members are even talking about Turkey’s exit from NATO, which will be a huge blow to the alliance as Turkey has the second strongest army after the United States.

Turkish-Russian relations are quite good. We are not friends, we have conflicting interests in several regions, but we have quite strong business and interpersonal ties. Turkey became the most important logistical hub for the remaining trade between Russia and Europe.

Russian diplomats have already succeeded in promoting reconciliation between Turkey and Syria and if things go as they are, chances for Erdogan’s meeting with Assad will increase. This will bring the end of Syrian conflict even closer and will be a clear diplomatic victory for Russia. 

Bringing Turkey to the Russian camp would mean a really big blow for NATO and acts of European radicals are turning it from something unimaginable into a realistic prospect.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,3329.0,7.0,2023-01-30T17:31:48+00:00,,,[],,MessageMediaWebPage,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,0.0,2.0,MessageEntityBold,3.0,91.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,158.0,18.0,MessageEntityBold,883.0,124.0,MessageEntityBold,2462.0,284.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,562.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,562.0,,,,,MessageReplies,9.0,25478.0,False,[],,17850.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WebPage,3.184140501642497e+18,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Message,17568,1639836943,2023-01-25T11:37:51+00:00,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"💬 Recent broad discussions in Europe and the US have raised an issue of Western tank supplies to Ukraine. 

It is obvious that Ukraine is already out of reserves of Soviet-type tanks and without these supplies it won’t just fail its offensive preparations but won’t even be able to defend against the ongoing advance of Russian forces.

However these Western tanks won’t help Ukraine much. US General Mark Hertling (ret.) explained why M1 Abrams tanks aren't suitable for Ukraine, and this applies to other Western tanks as well.

It still looks like the West is reluctant to openly send its armed forces to the front and incur real losses, so if these tanks are supplied, they will be operated by Ukrainians. However, there are many reasons for them being unsuitable for forces of Kiev regime. 

Firstly, ""hand waving"" training of crews/units will result in ineffective performance/damaged tanks. Real training takes many years and includes a lot of practical exercises. Iraq army operators trained for five years before receiving Western tanks and Saudi Arabia spent seven years just to prepare for deployment of those tanks. Obviously, AFU doesn’t have that time.

Moreover, the Abrams tanks require extensive firing training. Without proper training it will be as good as useless.

Secondly, tank drivers also need thorough training. Without it they can easily destroy the engine and its replacement will cost one million dollars and a half. 

Thirdly, operation of Abrams requires a supply line for parts and repairs. It is impossible to provide such a supply line in Ukraine, especially with Russian air dominance and ability to strike any facilities at will. 

Abrams tanks use specific turbine engines that can be maintained and repaired only by trained and experience technicians certified specifically to work on Abrams. Ukraine has no such specialists and it’s unlikely that the U.S. will provide its own technicians for this purpose.

Ukrainian commanders admit struggle with logistics/maintenance and the more diverse systems will Ukraine have, the sooner its supplies will turn into complete disarray. Russia also won’t seat idle as it continuously keep strikes on enemy’s military and logistical facilities, and this will amplify the chaos.

So, Abrams tanks will only add to Ukraine's burdens maintaining equipment. Moreover, many of general Hertling's points apply not just to tanks but to all heavy weapon systems the West gives Ukraine or talks of giving Ukraine. 

Considering all of the above, it is quite likely that any Western tanks that do arrive to Ukraine won’t go east of Lviv. What will they do in Lviv?

NATO plans to increase production of ammunition to support Ukraine and requests alliance members to increase military expenses to at least 2% GDP.

Mircea Geoană, NATO Deputy Secretary General announced the need to significantly increase production of weapons and ammunition for Ukraine and NATO’s own defense. He also mentioned that NATO countries must continue increasing their military expenses and that 2% GDP is not a desired value but a minimum, base level.

This way the alliance acknowledges that munition plants of NATO countries are unable to fulfil the demands of Ukraine in its conflict with Russia. While the West regularly speaks about Russian shortages of ammunition, it seems they are just projecting their own problems on Russia.

Russia has no problems with artillery shells or any other ammunition. It may be surprising to many, but Russian defense industry currently produces more high caliber shells than US military industrial complex. 

Western military experts continuously note that Russia spends more artillery shells than Ukraine. Ukraine is already close to ammunition shortage and globally praised US defense industry is unable to cover this shortage. Moreover, they won’t be able to do it even after planned expansion of production capacity by 2024-2025. 

When they talk about significant increase of capacities, they don’t mean it will happen in one day. It will take at least 1-2 years, and AFU capabilities during that period will be greatly restricted. 

Russia is not planning to extend the SMO for years or decades and no token aid from the West will save Kiev regime from the fate it deserved. 

As for NATO, they better stop planning expansion of weapon industry and acknowledge reality. It’s time to stop supporting crazy neo-Nazis and start talking to Russia about new security framework. 

Although NATO’s military industry has limited capacity, the North Atlantic Alliance is still very strong. However, it didn’t start open war against Russia and will not do it because it will mean inevitable retaliation strike.

Without direct interference of NATO their military aid to Ukraine will not save Zelensky’s regime. It is unlikely that NATO will be able to increase the production capacity before Russian SMO ends. 

However, it’s too early to relax. NATO leaders are not fools and if they are increasing production, it means that they are preparing for future conflicts. Maybe those won’t be conflicts with Russia, but Russia should not rely on that. 

Russia needs to look beyond Ukraine. Ending SMO as soon as possible is the primary and most important objective, but the end of SMO will not mean the end of conflict between Russia and NATO.

Recent Russian advances near Soledar and Artemovsk contradict “Ukrainian offensive momentum” narrative and ruin its image in the collective West. Real achievements are the best thing to break fake narratives. And the real thing is that Ukraine has not captured a single town in battle. 

Russian operations are consistent with the demilitarization objective for the special military operation. Desperate AFU attempts to defend hopeless position result in immense losses of manpower and equipment.

Artemovsk and Soledar are fortified cities along one of Ukraine’s last defensive lines in the Donbass region. Fall of that defense line will open Russia a path to liberate all of Donbass. Therefore, Kiev regime does not have much choice other than keep throwing demoralized and poorly trained forces into the cauldron. They are waiting for Western military aid hoping that it can turn the tide but Western military aid is not a panacea. 

The West is indeed announcing plans to send main battle tanks to Ukraine including Challenger 2 and Leopard 2 tanks. However, these tanks use different ammunition & both require an additional crew member (loader) increasing training demands for Ukrainian forces. 

The large variety of equipment the West is sending will create additional burdens for Ukrainian forces without any notable benefit. Tanks and artillery pieces are not supplied in hundreds and don’t even make up for Ukrainian losses. 

Moreover, Western main battle tanks have proven to be vulnerable to (Russian-made) modern anti-tank weapons even under relatively ideal conditions. When driven by poorly trained disorganized forces they will just become easy target.

Ukrainian forces will be going into battle without sufficient artillery or air cover and facing off against Russian forces reinforced with an additional mobilized men, new defenses and an influx of new weaponry. 

Kiev propaganda continues spreading their fake stories but they are no longer able to hide their losses. No more enthusiasm, nothing new or exciting in their speeches.

What will happen next? Western sponsors keep poking Kiev regime to launch offensives and show progress. However, Kiev doesn’t really have what it takes for a successful offensive. Losses in Soledar and Artemovsk areas have ruined those chances. 

Foreign mercenaries are willing to provide training and guidance but they are not willing to die for Ukraine, so Ukraine has to force mobilize random people on the streets to fill the ranks on defense. Moreover, offensive operations involve far greater casualties. Something to think about.

Kiev regime now faces some choices on the front. They can keep holding desperate positions in Artemovsk by sending more and more cannon fodder. They can fall back to next defense line and use all reserves to strengthen it. Or they can fall back, man the defenses, scrape everything they have and prepare an offensive. Neither option looks too promising. 

Of course, they also have another option – return to negotiations without any preconditions. That would be rational choice but rational thinking is not something associated with Zelensky regime.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2503.0,5.0,2023-01-17T15:53:59+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,21.0,MessageEntityBold,314.0,104.0,MessageEntityBold,524.0,186.0,MessageEntityBold,1228.0,231.0,MessageEntityBold,2103.0,79.0,MessageEntityBold,2327.0,108.0,MessageEntityBold,2619.0,355.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,545.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,545.0,,,,,MessageReplies,1.0,25478.0,False,[],,17442.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SMO can be ended only when there will be no threat to Russia from territory of Ukraine and there will be no discrimination of Russian-speaking population of the country. If this result can be achieved through negotiations, we are ready for this scenario. If not, all objectives will be achieved with military means. Neither Kiev regime nor its Western sponsors have learned necessary lessons from Ukrainian events.

This statement is yet another reiteration of Russian objectives. It notably does not specify territorial issues, so we can assume that liberation of the entire territory of four Russian regions is not a subject to discussion.

As for the rest, this official statement is notable as it gives more specific definition of denazification. Western media and politicians usually dismiss Russian objective of denazification stating that “there are no nazis in Ukraine that has a Jewish president”. They care about words and not about their meaning and they are firmly on Ukrainian side, so as long as Ukraine does not call itself “nazi”, they will deny it.  

Of course, they all understand the realities of Ukraine, but if it is just about calling Nazism “discrimination of Russian-speaking population of the country”, we can play along. If our former “partners” need everything explained in simple terms, Russia can do it.

Unfortunately, international forums have proven to be useless with regard to resolution of Ukrainian conflict. These institutions have been dominated by the West for a long time and are absolutely impotent when it comes to negotiations between the parties.

UN structures are under continuous pressure from the U.S. to take the side of Ukraine in the conflict and distort data in favor of Ukraine. This works, especially since most UN officials come from the West and its satellite countries. Lack of impartial coverage and assessment results in extension of Ukrainian conflict.

Russia keeps trying to promote its view in UN and it works to a certain extent, if we look at statistics of recent vote about condemnation of Nazism. By the way, Western countries that have all voted for glorification of Nazism actually understand that Russian denazification objective has all valid reasons. 

And yes, this also means that not just Ukraine needs denazification. Because Nazism is not only about concentration camps and gas chambers. Nazism is a manifestation of the idea of ethnic superiority, which is obvious in Ukraine. 

Western countries and especially the US do feel superior to other nations. They feel that their ideology is superior, they feel that their values are the only right values and aim to promote it. Moreover, they are not hesitating to use force for this purpose, when they feel they won’t meet resistance.

In geopolitics 2022 has been a year of big changes and future historians might even view it as the year when the Western world order was challenged. Of course, Russian Federation was in the center of all ongoing events. 

January saw last Russian attempts to maintain peaceful coexistence and mutually profitable trade with the West. Further plans of NATO expansion were not tolerable and around that time Russian leadership felt that Ukrainian conflict will never get resolved without real Russian intervention and made the decision to run a special military operation. 

Russian request to guarantee non-expansion of NATO and create a new security infrastructure was dismissed and this dismissal probably became the last drop that turned the scales. While the collective West still had an option to refrain from interference and acknowledge Russian security interests in its direct vicinity, they have chosen the other path. 

The option of attacking Russia directly was off the table from the very beginning. However, Russian adversaries still remembered their success in destruction of the USSR and so they started another project aimed to weaken Russia economically, incite internal unrest and install their own puppet government. 

This manifested in a full-scale information war and economic war against Russia. Unprecedented level of sanctions resulted in withdrawal of most Western companies from Russia and termination of economic ties that lasted for decades. A slander campaign of the scale that was never seen before followed the economic pressure. 

However, the plan did not work. Russia managed to preserve its economic strength and its internal unity through well calculated measures. The West failed to cripple Russia economically and did not manage to fool Russian people except a negligible minority that fled the country. 

Moreover, Russian geopolitical weight in the world has greatly increased. Three fourths of the world are now looking at Russia and cheering for it to succeed in its geopolitical stand against the new world order established by the collective West. 

Russia has offered the world an alternative vision of the future instead of US-dominated consumer society with inherent inequality and exploitation of the weak by the strong. Russian President has officially stated that while the time of unipolar world is gone. 

21st century will be the century of Asia and Russia has already started its geopolitical turn from the rotting West to the rising East. Russian partnership with Asian countries is growing stronger with every passing month and petty games and slander attempts of the collective West will not be able to change it.

▪️On December 30th Vladimir Putin had traditional end-of-year video conversation with Chinese leader Xi Jingping and noted that Russian-Chinese relations are a perfect example of cooperation between large countries in 21st century. Russian President has noted that Russia and China have similar views on causes, progress and logics of global geopolitical transformation in the environment of unprecedented pressure and provocations by the West and defend not only their own interests but interests of all proponents of truly democratic world order and the right of countries to freely choose their own way. 

Together, Russia and China have all chances to establish the new world order. Inevitable Russian victory in Ukrainian conflict will embolden more countries to challenge the West-dominated world order and firmly stand on the Russian side.

Experts acknowledge that European economy is already in recession and it will intensify next year even more. High inflation and energy shortage push a strong pressure on EU industry, salary increases are falling short behind inflation, consumer demand falls and this is triggering a chain reaction that will manifest most noticeably in the coming year.

This report greatly contradicts optimistic statements of European politicians, which in fact turn to be quite void. This year Europe managed to reduce its energy consumption by 20 percent. But how was it achieved? Despite widely publicized household energy-saving measures, they account just for a tiny bit of energy consumption. Expensive transition to energy-efficient technologies also helped a tiny bit, but the lion’s share of energy saving is due to reduced consumption by European industry. 

Plants are reducing production, businesses close, companies see lower profits and are looking for ways to cut costs. Facing much higher energy costs and falling demand they are virtually forced to “optimize” labor costs, resulting in even more unemployment, even lower demand and so on.

For many decades European industry was considered innovative and competitive, for many years European income level was considered relatively high as compared to most other countries. We knew that a good part of high income was compensated with high costs of living, but we thought that aside for that best European countries are really demonstrating outstanding competence in running their economies. 

However, it turned out that all of this was just an illusion and the real foundation of European competitiveness was very simple — cheap Russian energy that it was getting from USSR and later Russia. With few exceptions such as Norway that has its own energy resources, the competitiveness of Europe was dependent on Russian energy and it was an incredible level of dependence that nobody could even imagine.

Energy prices impact industry not only directly through the energy it consumes but also indirectly through increased prices on components and higher costs of storage and transportation. Even slight increase in energy prices has multiplicative effect on manufacturing costs of final product. 

Now just think, Europe now pays 2-4 times more for its energy. Consumer sector is subsidized, but subsidies won’t work for industry. Paying billions to subsidize companies and getting back millions in taxes does not sound like a plan. It can work for a short period, but European pockets are not endless and the crisis spiral is already in motion. 

In face of inevitable increase of global demand for energy, the Eurozone sees itself in completely uncompetitive position. The euro bubble will sooner or later burst out, and European authorities can do little to prevent it.

Still, it can be a good sign for Europe as well. When Europe shifts to survival mode, there is a good chance that hardships will finally open the eyes of European people and they will kick out globalist talking heads out and elect new generation politicians out of more reasonable people.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,3086.0,6.0,2022-12-29T14:20:10+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,270.0,MessageEntityBold,1018.0,115.0,MessageEntityBold,1709.0,199.0,MessageEntityBold,2475.0,69.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,535.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,535.0,,,,,MessageReplies,10.0,25478.0,False,[],,17122.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nothing could be further from what is really going on. Russian leader is not asking for negotiations, he is just saying that Russia is open to diplomatic resolution of the conflict.

▪️Russia has been ready to accept Ukrainian surrender ever since the beginning of the special operation, nothing changed here. Ukraine knows Russian terms and whatever is the picture that Western MSM try to create, this picture has little to do with reality. And the reality has been obvious from the very beginning.

As for guarantees, yes, it’s a hard question. Probably everyone in Russia remembers the story of Minsk Agreements that were never implemented while their supposed European guarantors have acknowledged that their objective was just “win time to arm Ukraine”. So, it is highly unlikely that Russia will agree to that sort of deal and step on the same rake once again. 

This time Russia will require permanent solution and more serious guarantees strengthened by immediate actions that have to be done before anything is signed. Yes, everyone needs guarantees. Ukraine may also need some guarantees, and Ukraine may even get those guarantees but it first has to make sure that the story of last eight years will never repeat.

▪️From Russian side it is obvious that Russia will not accept any guarantees by Europe. The memory of European betrayal is too fresh. Guarantees will have to come from the United States in form of written binding agreements and they must include China as another guarantor to make sure US don’t forget their promises right when the ink gets dry.

▪️As for Ukraine, the initial Russian proposal was absolutely fair. If Russia, US and any willing European countries guarantee territorial integrity and safety of Ukraine, if Ukraine is fast-tracked to EU, it should feel safe enough to demilitarize. The only thing Russia objects to is any kind of NATO membership and NATO bases in new Ukraine in any form.

Demilitarization is obviously needed. As it stands now, Ukraine has the second largest army in Europe after Russia. Armed with NATO weapons, fielding NATO military equipment, using NATO air defense systems. Even before the conflict Ukraine was excessively militarized and its military was much larger than needed for a country of this scale.

▪️So, what will make Ukraine safe from Russian intervention in future? Constitutional amendments establishing neutrality of Ukraine and granting equal rights, freedom of speech and freedom of speaking native language to all its citizens.

Message,17064,1639836943,2022-12-28T17:01:30+00:00,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"Russia has finally responded to oil price restrictions implemented by European Union and the collective West. Yesterday President Putin has signed a decree that prohibits sale of oil and oil products under supply contracts that directly or indirectly specify any restrictions of prices. 

⬜️ The decree comes into effect on February 1st and will first apply only to supplies of oil. The government of the Russian Federation was ordered to prepare the timeframe and the list of oil products that will also be subject to new restriction.

While the oil part was expected and has been previously announced, adding oil products to the restriction list means that Russian response is very real and that these measures are not just for the show. 

⬜️ This is important because it shows that Russia won’t circumvent its own prohibition by supplying new products like “crude oil mix” in compliance with the price cap. The price cap is simply being dismissed. Russian oil exporters won’t be able to circumvent the decree for profit. 

Moreover, the decree refers to contracts, so any countries willing to buy Russian oil or oil products won’t be able to acknowledge the price cap even if the contract price falls within its limits. 

⬜️ It should have been clear from the very beginning that Russia will not accept any kind of restrictions. Western sanctions restrict shipment and insurance but Russian partners in Asia are already working on creation of alternative shipping and insurance schemes. 

OPEC countries and other oil exporters have already spoken against the price cap and this means that at the very least they will support Russia by reselling its oil and at the very best they will help Russia and its Asian partners with alternative shipment insurance structure that will be completely independent from the West.

Virtually all oil and gas exporters are outraged with European ideas to establish price restrictions. Even U.S. companies have spoken against the idea. This creates a precedent and this is a precedent that no seller would endorse. In fact, with this move the collective West has pushed OPEC+ to Russian camp. What they say is one thing, but what they think and what they do is another thing. 

⬜️ Current fluctuations of oil prices are not very relevant. Global demand for energy and energy prices greatly depend on Asia, the industrial powerhouse of the world. China, the largest economy in the world, is gradually lifting its COVID restrictions and as its industry will get into revival and growth mode, the demand for energy will skyrocket. 

Asia will have access to Russian resources and resources from the Middle East enjoying better prices. Europe will not enjoy this luxury. Of course, they can attempt to impose price cap on OPEC oil as well. In this case the cartel will respond and this response will be deadly. Neither Russia, nor OPEC will perish if they suspend supplies to Europe. They have alternative customers in the East. Europe doesn’t have this luxury. 

⬜️ What should be expected? Steady growth of oil prices in 2023, increase of Chinese demand, more energy saving initiatives in Europe in an attempt to fit in the unfittable energy budget.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2305.0,3.0,2022-12-28T17:03:11+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,289.0,MessageEntityBold,289.0,2.0,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,289.0,2.0,MessageEntityBold,291.0,92.0,MessageEntityBold,742.0,2.0,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,742.0,2.0,MessageEntityBold,744.0,166.0,MessageEntityBold,1225.0,2.0,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,1225.0,2.0,MessageEntityBold,1227.0,104.0,MessageEntityBold,1492.0,329.0,MessageEntityBold,2215.0,2.0,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,2215.0,2.0,MessageEntityBold,2217.0,58.0,MessageEntityBold,2567.0,430.0,MessageEntityBold,2997.0,2.0,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,2997.0,2.0,MessageEntityBold,2999.0,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,532.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,532.0,,,,,MessageReplies,1.0,25478.0,False,[],,17065.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is a number of frozen or potential conflict zones where the West can escalate the situation aiming to achieve its objectives. Different publications in Western media have named all frozen conflicts at the territory of ex-USSR and a number of problem zones elsewhere in the world. Some also mentioned a potential for new color revolutions in Russia-friendly countries.

Situation in ex-USSR is less alarming as it is located in direct vicinity of Russia and Russia is more than capable to respond to most of potential problems there. 

▪️While Russia guarantees safety of Armenia within the scope of ODKB, it largely stays out of Karabakh conflict. Ever since the change of government in Yerevan Armenia has been trying to flirt with the West but it cannot play against geography and survive surrounded by hostile countries without Russian protection.

▪️Georgia still remembers the lessons of 2008 and has openly stated that it is not “opening a second front” despite numerous requests from Ukraine and the collective West. The present government is more pragmatic than its predecessors and it even refused to participate in sanctions against Russia, which gave some boost to Georgia as an intermediary country. They are still far from Russian friends but first steps towards reconciliation have already been made. Therefore, Abkhazia and South Ossetia can remain confident about their safety.

▪️However, there is one more frozen conflict at the post-Soviet space and it is still possible that the West will attempt to escalate it as well — this is Transnistria. With radically anti-Russian government in power and a carrot in form of EU candidate status, Moldova can be lured to attack Transnistria. Its own army is not a threat to Russian forces there or Transnistrian army, but there is a chance that it will be reinforced by Romanians and other NATO members. 

If Moldova does attack Transnistria with direct NATO aid, this will probably mean the beginning of the next world war. The West surely knows it and does not favor this scenario, but they may resort to various tricks, especially if there will be a real risk of Russia creating a land corridor to Transnistria. The area has been calm after some terrorist attacks and escalation attempts in spring, but this may change any moment.

The last option of the West is its favorite — the color revolutions. Their potential targets are currently Belarus and Kazakhstan. 

In January ODKB has quelled an attempt to incite such revolution in Kazakhstan, the situation may repeat. Kazakhstan’s authorities are seriously concerned about this threat and are undertaking extra security measures for the holiday season. Still, the situation looks more or less stable. 

As for Belarus, it is in the same boat with Russia. Belarussian people understand what is going on and are not ready to share the fate of Ukraine. 

So, while the West surely wants to escalate more conflicts in ex-USSR, its ability to do so is very limited and Russia can handle any challenges there without diverting resources from the main objective — denazification and demilitarization of Ukraine.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2235.0,5.0,2022-12-28T15:03:48+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,277.0,MessageEntityBold,652.0,166.0,MessageEntityBold,2149.0,562.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,531.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,531.0,,,,,MessageReplies,9.0,25478.0,False,[],,17154.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The West has the potential to escalate situation in many corners of the world aiming to achieve its objectives while a significant part of Russian resources is tied in Ukraine. We have already covered the situation in ex-USSR states and potential challenges that Russia can face there. In this publication we will turn to other parts of the world where the collective West can promote its plans.

▪️The first and most notable area is Serbia. Tensions have been growing there for some time initiated by actions of Kosovo police. Kosovo enjoys virtually unlimited support by NATO and there have been reports that NATO have issued an ultimatum to Vucic demanding him to enforce dismantling of all barricades in Serbian parts of Kosovo. 

While Serbian leader did put the army on high alert, it is unlikely that he will be able to withstand the pressure of NATO. In case of military escalation Serbian army has a chance to stand against Kosovo defense force and even against KFOR, but not a single chance to prevent the repeat of 1999. 

Even if Russia wanted to aid Serbia, air space of neighboring countries is closed for Russian planes. Violation would likely result in open collision with NATO meaning another World War while chances for saving Serbia would remain slim. China and other independent countries may sympathize with Serbia but they are also not going to commit military resources to its cause, especially considering logistical difficulties.

So, it is just a question of how far and how strong will the West push and whether it will reach a consensus about Serbian issue. Vucic will have the choice between submission and suffering of his people and his choice is quite obvious. Maybe he’ll even get a carrot in form of EU membership for Serbia. 

▪️Syria is another front where the West can attempt to push out Russia, but as the position of Bashar Assad has been secured with Russian help, it is unlikely that anything safe for full-scale invasion will change the situation. Russia keeps control of the situation and is closely coordinating its activities with Turkey, which has its own interests in Syria. Moreover, Russia has secured a meeting between Erdogan and Assad, which may open a way to peace in the region with the only alien force there being Americans controlling the oil fields. 

Recent statements of Ukraine’s Kuleba show that there is one more hot spot where the West may direct its attention, and this hot spot is Iran. The script of his call to attack Iranian industrial facilities under pretext of sending supplies to Russia was likely prepared in Washington and it is quite possible that the U.S. is seriously considering another war in the Middle East to restore its image after Ukrainian failure.

However, Iran is not Iraq or Afghanistan and is more than capable of defending itself against any invasion force NATO can scrap. It won’t be a small victorious war that the West likes and despite endless attempts to incite civil unrest in Iran, Persian people are likely to forget their internal differences in face of external enemy. 

Other potential theaters are less relevant for Russia, so the only real possible loss is Serbia. Russia will surely use its diplomatic weight to try and defend its brotherly Slavic country. However, chances to save it from clutches of the West look slim.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2007.0,3.0,2022-12-28T13:05:40+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,194.0,MessageEntityBold,371.0,264.0,MessageEntityBold,929.0,299.0,MessageEntityBold,1650.0,129.0,MessageEntityBold,1958.0,227.0,MessageEntityBold,2931.0,337.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,530.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,530.0,,,,,MessageReplies,7.0,25478.0,False,[],,17129.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Responsible leadership would have already surrendered or at least entered peace negotiations, but it’s not about Ukraine — if Ukraine had responsible leadership, there would be no conflict altogether. 

▪️Many people in Russia, Ukraine and even rest of the world hoped that the bloodshed will end this year. It looked like that non-violent resolution was close in spring and Russia has even withdrawn its forces from some regions as a gesture of goodwill. However, it turned out that Kiev regime was using negotiations to win time to mobilize people and secure weapon supplies from the West. As soon as they managed to do it, they immediately came with Bucha provocation sacrificing their own citizens for an excuse to withdraw from negotiations.

▪️Ever since spring the Ukrainian side backed by a notorious alliance of neocons and neoliberals in the United States has been denying reality and refusing any kind of talks with Russia. For several months until August Russia was still hoping that forces of reason in Ukraine will prevail and that Ukrainian people will overthrow the criminal regime that dragged them to this war. This did not happen. On the contrary, semi-fascist regime has strengthened its grip over Ukrainian people and started talking of its victory emboldened by seemingly endless supplies from their Western patrons.

By autumn Ukraine managed to mobilize a huge army on Western money and enjoyed some local successes. This made Zelensky and his cronies even more impudent and so-called leader of Ukraine has completely dismissed the idea of talks with Russia. Ever since then crazy addicts that took over Kiev have been absolutely confident in their victory. They did not worry that Ukraine got bankrupt back in summer, they did not worry about lives of their people and they did everything they could to escalate the conflict. 

Naturally, Russia did not sit idle and Russian Armed Forces got serious in face of terrorist attacks arranged by Ukraine and the collective West. While still trying sparing civilians, Russia resorted to missile and drone strikes against Ukrainian military facilities and dual-purpose infrastructure. These strikes were incredibly successful and any other country would get to its senses, but getting to senses is not about Ukraine. Zelensky’s government cannot be even called a government, it’s more like a colonial administration that strictly follows orders of its American masters.

Even now, when Ukrainian energy grid is almost completely disabled, people suffer from cold and hunger, combat units have lowest morale and Western backers are running out of supplies, Zelensky and Co. are sticking to their previous starting position — Ukraine is the winner. 

Although Russia is ready to return to negotiation table, Ukrainian preconditions are a product of a drugged mind that is very far from reality. This means that we won’t leave this conflict in 2022 and it will continue to 2023. If fascist wimps don’t want negotiations, there will be no negotiations.

Message,16990,1639836943,2022-12-26T09:08:55+00:00,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"💸 In the beginning of December U.S. Congress has approved a 4500-page budget of U.S. Defense Ministry. More detailed studying of this document shows some interesting things about military production aimed to replenish supplies of ammunition to Ukraine. 

NATO members including the U.S. have already been reporting alarming depletion of their stockpiles over the course of 2022 and the new U.S. budget provides for replenishment of these stockpiles. However, this budget document that targets the period of next 4-5 years reveals that US defense industry is unlikely to be able to fulfil Ukrainian needs at present level even if it sends its entire output to Kiev regime. 

Zelensky’s visit to the U.S. did not bring him any extra benefits in form of more modern weapons with notable exception of a single Patriot battery, which still cannot provide defense against Russian drones or hypersonic missiles and is thus unlikely to see actual combat use.  

Therefore, it is feasible to assume that the range of supplies won’t be expanded and Ukraine won’t be getting what it needs. 

▪️Expected annual production of 155-mm shells will be about 216,000 per year (median). This includes both mortar and artillery shells. According to senior NATO official quoted by CNN, in summer the Ukrainians were firing 6000 to 7000 artillery rounds each day. It means that yearly U.S. produce will last Ukraine no more than a month. If Ukraine doesn’t have other sources, it will be limited to less than 600 shells per day. Again, that is if everything U.S. produces is sent to Ukraine. 

Production of Stinger missiles is set to be 1,400 per year (median) while production of Javelin missiles is planned in the amount of about 7,000 per year (median). In the beginning of SMO Ukrainians bragged to use 500 of each per day. If we believe them, they will have enough Stingers for 3 days and enough Javelins for 2 weeks. Even as those numbers are way off, it is unlikely that U.S. can sustain these supplies for long. 

▪️According to Ukraine, they are almost out of 152-mm shells and while Ukroboronprom has pompously announced start of their production in the end of November, they remained shamefully silent about production volumes. As the result, NATO has turned to Slovakia to restart a plant for producing Soviet-standard ammunition. 

Would Slovakian arms industry do better than U.S.? I doubt anyone would bet on that, but Zelensky’s team surely does. 

The above U.S. production numbers are median, which means that they will increase as they ramp up production, so the initial capacity will be lower and last year capacity will be higher. However, even total numbers in 4-5 years are not impressive, especially considering outstanding performance of Russian arms industry.

Although Western statements about Russia running out of ammo come out every month, situation is in fact the opposite. Soviet stocks are depleted, NATO supplies are turning from an abundant river to a streamlet that is bound to get smaller and smaller with every month. 

Moreover, U.S. defense budget is aimed for U.S. It’s not Ukrainian defense budget and even completely brainwashed people should see and understand it.

Message,16922,1639836943,2022-12-23T09:42:16+00:00,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"📣 Ten months have passed since the historic meeting of Russian Security Council that resulted in acknowledgment of independence of Donetsk and Lugansk people republics. Ten months have passed since the onset of the Special Military Operation of Russian Armed Forces in Ukraine. 

Situation on Ukrainian front is a common knowledge, but it is not the only front. SMO marked a new stage in conflict between globalist vision of the collective West and vision of independent countries that want to maintain their sovereignty, culture and traditions and to develop their own way without following woke patterns.

Military aspect of the operation was secondary from the very onset. The main part of the conflict was going in different dimensions. Ten months is sufficiently long period of time to watch for intermediate results, so let’s see what has Russia gained.

⬜️ Russia managed to undermine the global faith in US dollar. While in the beginning of the year the whole world was skeptical about the possibility of that, in November and December international deals in rubles, rupees and yuan became a routine deal.

⬜️ Russia managed to undermine global faith in Western democracy and freedom. The West has shown their true face by blatantly manipulating public opinion, censoring Russian channels and attempting to shut down any information sources that contradict their narrative.

⬜️ Russia managed to undermine the global faith in Western financial institutions. The collective West has shown their true face by freezing Russian assets, which is now becoming a trend. Even firm allies of the US in the third world are now worried about what can happen if they displease the hegemon. 

⬜️ Russia managed to give a kickstart to a new world order with more and more countries drifting to BRICS and its alternative economic projects aiming to steer away from the collective West that ties economic benefits with demands to embrace Western culture and Western values no matter how alien they are to the country in question. 

⬜️ Russia managed to split a crack between U.S. and its EU allies. In face of energy crisis the U.S. has turned to prey on Europe and not all Europeans are happy about it. Moreover, the U.S. is aiming to lure European industry to the Western hemisphere and impotent EU leaders can do little to oppose that.

⬜️ Russia managed to undermine the global faith in American and European defense industries. It turned out that they are not able to sustain even a second-rate military conflict against a strong adversary without stripping off reserve supplies of their own military forces. 

⬜️ Russia managed to survive the hardest blow that the collective West could deal — unprecedented economic sanctions, severance of trade ties and withdrawal of a large part of Western companies from Russia. Moreover, economic consequences for Russia are much less than those suffered by the West.

While Medvedev’s trip did not enjoy broad coverage in global media, it is far more important than yet another boring one-man show of Zelensky. 

Russian ex-President met with Chinese leader Xi Jingping in state residence in Beijing where the parties discussed strategic partnership of Russia and China in all sectors, including economy and industry collaboration as well as cooperation between the United Russia and the Chinese Communist Party. 

Over the past 10 years, China-Russia relations have withstood the test of changes in the international landscape and always developed at a sound and stable high level, said Xi Jingping.

It is a long-term strategic choice made by China and Russia based on their own national realities to develop a comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era.

The long-term institutionalized exchanges between the CPC and the United Russia party have become a unique channel and platform for China and Russia to consolidate mutual political trust, promote mutually beneficial cooperation and showcase strategic coordination, providing solid support for the long-term and stable China-Russia relationship in the new era, Chinese leader added.

Noting that the exchanges between the ruling parties of China and Russia are entering the third decade, Xi Jingping voiced hope that the two parties will continue their in-depth communication on governance experience and how to promote the dovetailing of development strategies and advance multilateral cooperation among political parties.

The two sides should learn from each other on the ruling parties' building and contribute wisdom and strength to the deepening of China-Russia comprehensive strategic coordination, he said.

Xi Jingping has reiterated China's stance on the Ukraine crisis, emphasizing that the Chinese side always decides its position and policy based on the merits of the matter itself. China is committed to an objective and impartial stance, and it actively promotes peace and facilitates talks, he said.

It is hoped that all parties concerned can remain rational and restrained, engage in comprehensive dialogue and resolve common security concerns through political means, said the Chinese leader. Medvedev said the Ukraine crisis happens for a reason, which is ""very complicated,"" adding that Russia is willing to solve the problems it faces through peace talks.

💬 Several online sources have noted that Medvedev’s visit coincided with arrival of several heavy cargo planes from Russia to China. While non-public part of negotiations will probably remain classified for a long time, it’s not a secret that after the 20th CPC National Congress China has been intensifying its economic ties with Russia and mutual trade initiatives. In December Xi Jingping ordered Chinese officials to forge closer economic ties with Russia increasing Chinese imports of Russian oil, gas and farm goods, more joint energy partnerships in the Arctic and increased Chinese investment in Russian infrastructure, such as railways and ports.

Ukrainian commander in chief Zaluzhny has published a video addressed to Zelensky where he urges to impose harsher punishment for disobedience and desertion of Ukrainian soldiers. He stated that this is becoming a serious problem and that AFU has to replace forces with low morale, which results in territorial losses and increased casualties.

Looks like the Ukrainian military has no other way than to acknowledge continuous fall of morale and call for harsher measures against Ukrainian soldiers that are not willing to die for arrogance of Zelensky and Nazi dreams. 

▪️Ukraine has undertaken many waves of mobilization to replenish incredibly high losses of AFU with poorly trained recruits. New Russian tactics emphasizing destruction of enemy manpower have yielded its results and even brainwashed Ukrainian conscripts are getting a bit sober in face of certain death. 

As quality of AFU soldiers goes down, Ukrainian tactics of sending human waves in desperate attempts to hold doomed defense positions results in more and more losses. However, neither AFU generals nor Zelensky look ready to accept the reality — Ukraine has already lost. 

▪️Elite Nazi battalions and mercenaries try to avoid combat losses and usually act as blocking detachments forcing conscripts from East Ukraine to fight against their will. 

Why is Kiev regime doing this? They need to present their sponsors a picture of successes, a picture of impenetrable defense. Their main objective is not victory, their main objective is to secure as much financial and military aid from the West as possible and they don’t hesitate to sacrifice any number of Ukrainian citizens for this purpose.

▪️However, these sacrifices are very selective. Latest waves of mobilization were mainly focused on East and South Ukraine, areas with Russian-speaking population. This serves another objective of Kiev regime — eliminate all potential opposition. 

Continuous brainwashing of Russian-speaking Ukrainians did produce some results, but Zelensky’s regime is still afraid that one day they will get sober and see the truth. That is why those East Ukrainians are sent to die. More deaths result in lower chances of internal unrest and more seeds of hate between Russian and Ukrainian nations. 

▪️Even at the moment of their defeat Russophobes are doing everything they can to weaken pro-Russian sentiment and prevent inevitable expansion of the Russian world. Their propaganda keeps blaming Russia for everything ignoring the fact that Russians are not sending them to die and that Russia has given Ukrainians enough time to see who are their real enemies. 

The situation is unfortunate for Russian-speaking part of Ukraine, but Russia should not refrain itself. Increasing levels of desertion and insubordination are a good sign that AFU resistance will sooner or later collapse and every day makes this collapse closer. 

Recent Russian strikes on groups of foreign mercenaries are also yielding results. Once mercenaries flee and morale of forces at the front reaches its lows, even blocking detachments won’t help Kiev regime to prevent ultimate Russian victory.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1829.0,3.0,2022-12-21T16:08:53+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,460.0,MessageEntityBold,690.0,124.0,MessageEntityBold,1269.0,175.0,MessageEntityBold,1791.0,249.0,MessageEntityBold,2381.0,165.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,515.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,515.0,,,,,MessageReplies,2.0,25478.0,False,[],,17208.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After several months of discussions European countries came up with gas price cap. Is it time for Russia to worry? Absolutely not. They have spent several months seriously discussing the level of the price cap as if it had any relevance, Germany has delayed the decision many times by requesting a higher cap value that would be more ""acceptable"". All in vain.

Europeans seem to be serious that their idea of price setting by buyer will work and that Russia and any other gas exporters will be happy about it. Russian Federation has officially dismissed the idea of any kind of price restrictions on buyer side and attempts to create buyer cartel.

It looks like EU got emboldened by what they see as “success” of the oil price cap, with Russia having to sell its oil at discount to third-party customers. However, even oil-related restrictions are temporary and are related to shipping restrictions. Russia enjoys full support of virtually all oil and gas exporting countries in its attempts to avoid price cap, so lifting these restrictions is just a matter of time. 

▪️Even now discounts cover only Urals oil, while Russian crude mix is sold at market prices. As soon as Russia sets up a new alternative shipping system with the help of its allies, there will be no more hindrances to its export. However, the buyers will have long lasting problems that will only intensify as the demand for oil will rise with inevitable reopening of Chinese economy.

The situation with gas is even more dire. While Europe can barely survive this winter using gas reserves accumulated from Russian supplies in the first half of 2022 and sacrificing its industrial needs, the story does not end here.

2023-2024 heating season will be the toughest for Europe and situation won’t get better. Eventually they will run out of money and as their industry flees to the U.S. and China, there will be no new money coming.

Purchase of LNG from the United States combined with supplies from Norway will never cover full needs of the European Union. Even when Europe will build full-scale LNG infrastructure, it will still face shortage of supplies and will depend on LNG exporting countries much more than it depends on Russia. 

One of those LNG exporters is Qatar and its supplies will be critical for the few coming years in EU. However, recent EU corruption scandal involving Qatar is unlikely to cause good feelings and bring EU any trade preferences. While Chinese leader Xi Jingping has recently secured a record 27 year contract with one of the largest Arabian LNG exporters, European advances were less welcome. 

▪️Qatar traditionally separates politics from economic deals but European actions will definitely make it wary. Expected global energy deficit will be amplified by “green energy” initiatives, reopening of Chinese economy, reduction of Russian exports and industrial growth of South and South-East Asia.

So, yes, it’s time to worry for Europeans. The idea of buyer cartel under any excuses will alienate virtually all suppliers and this does include American companies as well.

Massive Russian strikes over Ukrainian energy grid with missiles and drones have virtually achieved their results. The power grid is down and this seriously hinders mobility of enemy forces, supplies and whatever is left of Ukrainian arms industry.

While Zelensky’s regime is trying to pretend that nothing serious has happened, they have already prohibited citizens talk about blackouts publicly. They pretend that those without electricity are a part of “the unfortunate 1 percent”. That’s their usual math, the one they use to calculate casualties, secure financial aid and so on. 

Kiev rulers are acting as if they have already secured victory, and this makes sense for them — nobody will send money to losers and extracting money from the West is becoming the favorite sport of Zelensky and Co.

They are virtually forcing citizens to stay at cities without stable supply of power, hot water and central heating. They lie because they need to show a nice picture to their sponsors. We have always known that well-being of civilians has zero relevance to Kiev regime, they have already proven it with there endless shelling of Donbass. 

▪️By the way, that shelling still continues — while people in the West were watching FIFA World Cup, Ukrainian artillery have launched a massive strike against civilian hospital in Donetsk that involved casualties. It was just the last of the series of similar strikes against residential buildings, temples, cafes and other civilian infrastructure. 

These strikes have no military sense, there were no military objects or armed forces in the vicinity of impacted areas. In fact, they perfectly fit definition of war crime. Moreover, Ukraine still claims Donetsk to be its territory but it does not have any concerns about people that it wants to return… or not. In fact, it’s common knowledge that Ukraine just wants those rich lands, no people needed. 

▪️The Ukrainian regime enforces “stay home” agenda for several reasons, and the main reason is that if Zelensky allows people to leave, Ukraine will get empty. EU will face another migration crisis while it hasn’t even barely accommodated to the previous one. Several more millions of Ukrainian migrants in EU will inevitably cause an explosion among local people and they will start looking for someone responsible. 

▪️Zelensky is too minor figure to answer for all European problems but his helpers are still around —EU parliament, EU government, leaders of EU countries. All those proponents of “solidarity with Ukraine” who decided that a chance for a victorious war is worth suffering of their people. No way.

So, Ukrainian energy grid is down. Zelensky regime may extend its agony by a couple more weeks with help of Europeans, so Russian pressure has to continue. Next priority targets are air defense, supply lines and fuel facilities. 

▪️The greater is the Russian pressure, the higher is the chance that Zelensky will no longer be able to hide the truth from his sponsors and, more importantly, from his people.

Henry Kissinger, a ninety-nine-year-old veteran of international politics, published an article in the Spectator, where he proposed his own solution of the Ukrainian crisis. His proposal can be viewed as a sign of what the collective West can offer Russia, and for now this is only one thing — international recognition of status quo before February. This is absolutely unacceptable to Russia and a seasoned diplomat deeply respected by Putin could offer something more realistic.

It is unclear whether the collective West understands that its offers are futile and whether they are objectively assessing the situation in Ukraine. Such offers should not be coming in view of imminent collapse of Ukrainian state. It would sound as if Hitler proposed to return to 1939 borders in 1945.

Moreover, this offer like all previous Western offers concentrate on territorial issues. Looks like they don’t see that Russian primary objective in Ukraine is not territorial expansion of the Russian Federation but denazification of Ukrainian state as none of their “peace plans” cover this issue. 

▪️What kind of proposal would be acceptable to Russia? Russian terms are well known and they include much more than acknowledgment of referendums in new Russian regions. However, Russia does not refuse to talk without any preliminary conditions. So maybe instead of voicing half-hearted proposals through retired diplomats, the West should indeed start talking. 

🔺For starters, Western powers have to cease supplies of weapons and ammunition to Kiev regime and withdraw all their military personnel from the territory of former Ukrainian SSR. Ukrainian troops have to lay down weapons and withdraw from territory of new regions of the Russian Federation. All attacks against Russian military forces and civilians have to be stopped.

🔺However, even this will not be enough. The Ukrainian crisis has to be solved once and for all but it’s just a manifestation of the conflict between Russia and the West. European leaders are right when they speak about the need for new security framework in Europe and they are right that such a framework cannot exist without Russia. 

The very paradox of the situation is that NATO understands that it cannot win a conventional or unconventional war against Russia. They are pushing, trying to overstretch Russia, trying to incite a color revolution for regime change, trying to strangle Russia economically. However, they cannot resort to direct and open use of force because it will be the end of them as well. 

So, NATO-Russia talks are also a must and these talks should be aimed to discuss the future of NATO and its existence or dissolution in post-Ukrainian world.

What about talking to Ukraine? Well, Ukraine is not capable of negotiations and it is not an independent subject of the international policy. Ukraine has been defeated around August.

Yes, there is always a chance to find a path to reconciliation, even in the most dire circumstances and even after the most radical disagreements. Relations between geopolitical entities are not a matter of mutual sympathy but rather a matter of balance of interests and mutual trust. 

▪️The biggest obstacle to reset of West-Russian relations is definitely the loss of trust. Hypocritical nature of the collective West also creates some problems, and yet another issue stems from the very fact that the West is not a monolithic entity. Despite all of the collective West countries accepting leadership of the U.S., they still perceive themselves independent entities and keep asking “Why us?”. 

▪️Why us? Was it Sweden that staged 2014 Maidan in Ukraine? Was it Italy that opened its NGOs in Central Asia? Was it Greece that placed biolabs in ex-USSR? Was it Finland what fueled the “Revolution of Roses” and endorsed Georgian leader’s dream to get to NATO at all costs? 

Of course, not. Countries of the “collective West” include Japan, South Korea, Australia and some other countries that are not part of the West. They rejected collective responsibility for actions of the Western block. It was all about Americans. 

Russia seemed to accept that approach but 2022 changed everything. Collective sanctions against Russia became a clear indicator of that. Revelations of German ex-chancellor Angela Merkel about bogey nature of Minsk agreements destroyed the trust completely. 

Without trust any reset of relations is a very hard process. Russia is the offended party and is actively pursuing its own purposes that no longer include the collective West. Will the West try to do it? Maybe yes. 

The initiative will most likely come from the USA. Despite their internal problems, the USA are still a great power, they are a sovereign country that can choose its foreign policy in accordance with its interests. They are still strong enough to acknowledge their mistakes.

EU has transformed into some amorphous swamp and is not respected anymore. Not in Moscow, not in Beijing, not in Washington. EU bureaucrats guided by some unclear motives are demolishing their relation with neighboring energy supplier Russia up to have their aggregated parliament qualify it as state sponsor of terrorism. 

The USA, on the contrary refrain to cut all bridges and even keep negotiating with Russia on their mutual interests, from the nukes to hostage exchanges. Moreover, 2024 is looming on the horizon and almost inevitable change of power in the United States may mark yet another turn in their foreign policy. 

▪️When Russia emerges victorious and strong from the Ukrainian conflict, it will be able to deal with the USA as an equal and, more importantly, will be accepted as an equal. Might makes right, and this rule has not gone anywhere. 

It doesn’t mean that Russia and US will become allies, friends or partners. It just means that the U.S. will become an important part of an emerging world order.

According to reports, the volley had more 60 missiles, most of which have successfully hit the intended targets. 

🔺This strike followed a statement by Pentagon earlier this week that Russian forces are running out of ammunition and that they will run out of it very soon. It looks like a Russian response to this statement as well as Ukrainian allegations that Russia produces only 40 missile in a months and will have its stockpiles depleted soon. 

🔺Naturally, Pentagon and Kiev have no access to real information about the capacity of Russian missile industry. We have been hearing statements that Russia ran out of missiles ever since the beginning of SMO. We have been continuously hearing that Russia has scraped its last reserves and is buying old missiles from countries like North Korea and Iran.

However, non-stop series of missile strikes since October proves that wishful thinking of Kiev regime and their American and European sponsors has nothing to do with reality. Strikes come every day, every day Ukraine has air alert and every day Zelensky and Co. keep lying to their people that Ukrainian victory is close.

🔺It’s worth noting that while Russia enjoys air superiority in Ukraine and enemy aircraft has virtually not chances, Russian Aerospace Forces don’t yet enjoy complete air dominance as the remains of Ukrainian air defense batteries and antiaircraft weapons make it not worth risking Russian bomber planes.  

When air defense capabilities of the enemy will be reduced to negligible level, missile strikes will be followed by bomb strikes. The opposite side understands it and desperately tries to boost Ukrainian air and missile defense capabilities, however this just doesn’t work.

🔺Moreover, Russian forces have resumed use of Geran-2 drones and other UAVs against enemy defenses, military and dual-purpose infrastructure. Neither Ukraine, not even NATO have the capabilities to repeal this type of combined attacks and it looks like Russian arms industry was much better prepared for this kind of conflict than industries of the entire collective West.

There have been no reports of any shortages of ammunition, there have not been a single week without massive missile strikes since October 10th. While NATO factories are desperately being repurposed for different types of production in a process that will take many months if not years, Russian defense factories are working three shifts and keep expanding their production volumes.

Last week the enemy acknowledged loss of 50% of their energy grid infrastructure. 3-5 more successful volleys like the one launched today will bring the damage level to over 70 percent, which will make it irreparable and will greatly restrict enemy’s abilities to move supplies and forces. 

That’s why any talks of some future Ukrainian offensives may cause only laughter. They surely may launch some last-chance suicide attacks, but it is unlikely that they will achieve any notable successes while any kind of military victory is virtually impossible without direct full-scale intervention of all NATO countries… and even then Russia would have far better chances than anyone could have expected.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2381.0,2.0,2022-12-17T12:09:40+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,248.0,MessageEntityBold,2612.0,292.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,509.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,509.0,,,,,MessageReplies,6.0,25478.0,False,[],,16821.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mateusz Morawiecki spoke to journalists before European Council meeting in Brussels and said that Europe is currently looking for money to implement continuously postponed “gas price cap”. According to Morawiecki, the EU should confiscate Russian oligarchs' assets to help Ukraine and European citizens.

""The money is there, it is USD 350 billion, with some suggesting it could be USD 400 billion, which could be used to reconstruct Ukraine and ease the consequences of the Russian aggression for European citizens,"" the prime minister said.

Last time when EU talked about frozen Russian money, they mentioned only Ukraine. Now they aim to “ease the consequences of the Russian aggression for European citizens.” What a nice way to say: “We’ll steal this money no matter what”. Morawiecki naturally vouches for “using this money to help countries that host Ukrainian immigrants” as Poland is the top destination for Ukrainian.

▪️The initial sanctions in form of freezing foreign assets of the Russian Federation have already dealt a huge blow to world’s trust to the West. The United States are smart enough and rich enough to avoid talking about any kind of confiscation. However, Europe went all in about its crusade for self-destruction, and first signs of this are already manifesting — they are getting low on money. Investors are reluctant to trust their assets to institutions that cannot guarantee safety of these assets. 

Three fourths of the world views anti-Russian sanctions as arbitrary and has rightful reasons to worry about similar sanctions being applied to their own countries shall they say anything against dictate of the collective West.

Back in September some of the most reputable global investment banks stopped recommending their customers to invest in EU stocks or bonds and proposed investment in America, China and emerging countries. 

By the way, it looks like Polish prime minister is once again trying to divide bear skin while the bear is still living. 

In recent interview to Estonian media Charles Lichfield, a senior finance expert at the Atlantic Council  said that United States and its European allies are unable to locate an estimated two-thirds or more of the Russian assets that they froze in a retaliatory response to Russia's military invasion of Ukraine in February. “ They just don’t know where exactly they the frozen funds are. 

The expert furthermore added that the EU and the US had, in actual, seized $80-$100 billion and not $300 billion Russian assets as was widely reported in the American media. The EU additionally froze $16.9 billion more in addition to the freezing previous assets in the Central Bank of Russia's foreign exchange reserves around the world. 

If the U.S. does not play along It means that Brussels actually has the capacity to confiscate about 8-10 times less than envisaged, and this won’t be nearly enough to compensate their expenses and losses. 

As for Ukraine, well, they were naturally dreaming how they will live a rich life on Russian money. Reality must be very disappointing.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2061.0,4.0,2022-12-16T14:14:55+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,362.0,MessageEntityItalic,362.0,212.0,MessageEntityBold,989.0,142.0,MessageEntityBold,1492.0,229.0,MessageEntityBold,2441.0,341.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,507.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,507.0,,,,,MessageReplies,3.0,25478.0,False,[],,16791.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EU Parliament has finally noticed the looming economic problems and potential loss of competitiveness of European industry. On Thursday, December 15 they are planning to discuss measures that can be taken to address the dire situation that the EU faces in short-term, mid-term and long-term perspective. 

Sanctions against Russia can indeed be compared to shooting oneself in a leg. While Russia did not really notice their impact, Europe is now facing one of the hardest challenges for its economy in all its history. As energy prices have soared, more and more large European businesses are looking to move their industrial facilities overseas. 

The United States have longed opposed cooperation between Russia and Europe in energy sector. Inexpensive Russian pipeline gas brought European industry incredible competitive advantages that negated disadvantages of high cost of labor and high tax burden. Moreover, it enabled many European industries such as the car industry to successfully compete with American enterprises at foreign markets that the U.S. considers their own playground. 

Now Europe finally got rid of its dependence on “non-democratic” Russian gas, and is no longer dependent on Russia. According to recent revelations of Werner Steinecker, ex-CEO of Austrian Energie AG, EU has signed 20-year LNG supply contracts with the United States based on “take or pay” formula that met such a harsh critics in Europe when it was used by Russia.

This means that European Union will have to pay the United States any “market price” just to meet their basic demands. Costs of energy are already rising and they are not so noticeable by European consumers only because of government subsidies. 

▪️Moreover, U.S. subsidies of their own industry may deal the last stroke to competitiveness of Europe although their long-term impact on U.S. economy is also controversial. European countries have little to do in response except for taking similar measures. 

France has proposed unrestricted subsidies to European industrial enterprises and this proposal is supported by many other EU countries with notable exception of Scandinavia that suffers less from the energy crisis. 

▪️The problem with industrial subsidies is that while they can give short-term boost to industry, they are not viable in long term. Subsidies can help create new industries, subsidies can help in production of critical things, but they cannot make industry competitive. 

European subsidies will effectively mean that European industry will yield losses to subsidizing countries. Competitiveness means low costs and European states will have to pay all the time to keep those costs low or face exodus of industry to other regions. This will put an end to relative wealth of the European Union.

🔴 Is there another way? Sure, they can resume their contracts with Russia. Will Russia agree on that? Unlikely. Too many things have been said and done to make it easy. Europe will have to pay if it wants to restore ties. Russia will not come begging for mercy, but if Europe will, they still have a chance to save themselves from turning into a third world region.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1998.0,4.0,2022-12-16T11:16:16+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,48.0,MessageEntityBold,175.0,182.0,MessageEntityBold,435.0,134.0,MessageEntityBold,1146.0,367.0,MessageEntityBold,2511.0,352.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,506.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,506.0,,,,,MessageReplies,2.0,25478.0,False,[],,16775.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Last week was marked with escalation of Kosovo crisis in Serbia when police forces of the unrecognized republic have entered Serbian municipalities in violation of previous agreements. Local Serbian population was rightfully worried about that and created barricades to prevent the dangerous outcome.

▪️After multiple discussions, official Serbian government decided to use legal methods to come to defense of Kosovo Serbs and appealed to UN resolution as well as Brussels agreements and Washington agreements filing a request to bring joint Serbian police and military forces to Serb-populated areas of the region.

However, the region is occupied by “peacekeeper” forces of NATO and numerous EU officials have already spoke in support of unrecognized Kosovo, which is about to submit a request for EU candidate status despite not being recognized by five countries of the EU — Cyprus, Greece, Romania, Slovakia and Spain. 

This is undoubtedly an artificial crisis that has been created by Kosovo authorities with tacit approval or even upon request of NATO. While formalizing the secession of the criminal-ridden republic from Serbia has always been the ultimate goal of the collective West, this specific moment was chosen for a reason, and the reason is Russia. 

▪️Russian special operation in Ukraine is running well and it does not look like Kiev regime will hold too much longer, especially if it ever gets off western life support. However, at the moment SMO draws a lot of Russian resources and other Russian capabilities are limited. 

If Serbian conflict gets escalated, and it most likely will get escalated as even very moderate Vucic cannot ignore moods in Serbian society and just acknowledge Kosovo and join anti-Russian sanctions, Russian capabilities of helping Serbia directly will be very limited.

If anything happens, Russia won’t even have an easy way to send any aid to Serbia as the country is landlocked and European air space is closed for Russian aircraft. While this aid can be dispatched through third countries, it’s still a serious restriction, especially if it is about military aid.

Seeing that Russia has turned the tide in Ukraine and its victory is just a matter of time, whatever it takes, NATO may even resort to military provocations by directly using force against Serbia and maybe exchanging Ukraine for Kosovo. 

If Russia tries sending any serious forces to Serbia, these forces will still be at huge risk and this will reduce Russian capabilities on Ukrainian front. A token force will most likely become a target of provocation, so there are really no good choices here.

However, one thing is important to remember. Russia is not charity. Last time when Russia helped Serbia, it triggered a World War, and this time such possibility is also on the table. 

▪️Serbia is Russia-friendly country, sure, but if they want Russian help, they finally have to choose a side officially. Worth noting that Serbia voted for UN GA resolution that condemned “Russian attack on Ukraine”. If Serbia was an unquestionable Russian ally, things would be simple. But as it stands, maybe refraining would be a better choice.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1821.0,6.0,2022-12-14T08:19:49+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,45.0,MessageEntityBold,233.0,117.0,MessageEntityBold,666.0,309.0,MessageEntityBold,1320.0,170.0,MessageEntityBold,1597.0,273.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,499.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,499.0,,,,,MessageReplies,12.0,25478.0,False,[],,17719.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bloomberg as well at the whole lot of Western mainstream media reported that it was a sudden decision made as the result of new nuclear threats made by Russian president on December 7th. 

▪️ Did Vladimir Putin really come up with nuclear threats or anything that can be interpreted as that? No. He specifically stated that Russian nuclear strategy has defensive purpose and Russian nuclear weapons are going to be used only as response to attacks. 

“We are not crazy, we understand what nuclear weapons are. We have them, and they are more advanced and innovative than those of any other country. It is an obvious fact.” — said Vladimir Putin at the meeting with President’s Human Rights Council adding that nuclear weapons are “not a factor that provokes escalation but a restrictive factor”. 

Western campaign of lies continues and they are doing everything in their power to slander Russia and its President presenting them as some maniacs threatening the whole world with nuclear weapons. In last four months Russian President has not voiced any direct threats about potential use of nuclear weapons, he even said that directly as response to numerous false accusations that came in September and October.

▪️ Their lies are not sophisticated and can be easily debunked by simply checking on actual transcripts of speeches and interviews of Russian President, Kremlin’s public relations office and statements of senior officials. All this information is available and moreover, most of it is translated into English, so audience of the global media can easily verify it.

The problem is that a huge part of this audience does not want to verify anything. They just read information and believe it. They are not doing fact-checking, they are not reading debunks, they are not doubting “reputable media”. 

This works not only in the West, but also in the third world, where “progressive” people are proud of learning to speak English and read English-language news. Many of them are as blind to numerous flaws of the Western media that appeared and grown like a cancer within the course of past two-three decades. 

▪️ Of course, Narendra Modi cancelled his meeting with Russian leader for a different reason. They have recently met in person in September, they had a lot of phone calls this year and next year India is hosting G20 summit and Modi has personally invited Vladimir Putin to visit New Delhi. 

Modi does support Russia in its conflict with the West, which is already a big surprise and another achievement of Russian diplomacy. In fact, India is now extending support by supplying Russia with more equipment and raw materials and increasing volumes of oil import from Russia.

Western media deliberately created lies in an attempt to deteriorate relations between Russia and India.

As time passes by, Western countries intensify their verbal support of Ukraine but weapon supplies to Ukraine are getting lower, countries of the collective West are almost out of stock and are scrapping for last bits of this and that everywhere. There are even talks of unearthing some reserves of old Soviet weapons stocked by Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi and sending these to Ukrainians. 

European countries are plunging deeper and deeper into economic crisis and the U.S. is stepping over their heads instead of stretching a helping hand to them. Controversial economic measures such as oil price caps do not help stabilization of global economy and China is securing far better deals in the Middle East than EU.

❗️The United States have already achieved their objective to deindustrialize Europe, strip it of competitive advantage in form of cheap Russian energy and lure European capitals and companies into U.S. jurisdictions. 

It is becoming obvious that end of the Ukrainian conflict will not be the end of conflict between Russia and the West and this conflict known as Cold War 2.0. will in fact only intensify after the end of the hot phase.

🔴 But what are the objectives of the U.S.-led collective West for this hot phase? 

There is only one big objective and only one chance for their side to win — installing a puppet regime in Russia. Since Russia is a nuclear superpower, this cannot be done from outside, so they used several different tactical approaches to try and achieve that.

First, they wanted to shock Russia with sanctions and cripple its economy. That is why they forced Ukraine to resist from the very beginning instead of immediate surrender. 

By summer, when Russian economy has recovered from the initial shock and showed unprecedented results, the collective West to a new method — increase military pressure. Mass supply of weapons, instructors, mercenaries and money did bring Ukraine some interim successes, however setbacks never made in impact on solidarity of Russian people with the government. 

When it turned clear that military victory is impossible, some Western politicians and military started getting around with the idea of freezing the conflict luring the Russian government into a trap of a temporary ceasefire agreement, so called “Minsk 3”. Russian public was indeed worried about possible ceasefire agreement on unfavorable term but Kremlin was firm in its position to fulfil all SMO objectives. 

❗️In fact, this uncertainty could last much longer, but Angela Merkel did a big service to Russia by revealing the true intention of previous Minsk Agreements — to win time and militarize Ukraine. Vladimir Putin expressed doubts on whether it is possible to achieve any agreements and what would guarantee them although said that some agreement is eventually inevitable.

The collective West failed to achieve quick victory and incite a regime change in Russia. They may resort to more plans but their support heavily depends on situation on the ground and their own capabilities, which are dwindling day after day. 

Russian tactics is working and there are many signs showing that Ukrainian state is close to collapse.

Last few weeks marked the beginning of some internal turmoil in upper circles in Ukraine. This mostly went below the radar because information coming from Ukraine is restricted and the Western media heavily censors it. 

There were reports about disagreements between Zelensky and nationalists, Zelensky and Zaluzhny-Klichko block, even Zelensky and some oligarchs such as Akhmetov. 

Nationalists think Zelensky is anything from a traitor to a Russian spy. They needed him as a façade to secure Western aid and he continuously promoted the narrative that Nazi country can’t have Jewish president.

It is unlikely that they will turn against Zelensky or use violence at this stage. It depends on the level of their desperation, but it will be very hard to sell the Western public a story of “good nationalists”. They are too notorious and they don’t have any more good actors like Zelensky who can play a victim, a nice guy, a hero or anything else and raise billions from compassionate Western public. 

▪️If nationalists overthrow Zelensky, Russia will have another leverage to push for stop of the Western aid to Ukraine. So, their victory could very well result in their defeat. 

Therefore, it is likely that they will make their move after Russian victory to gain power over what is left in Ukraine. Naturally, that depends on terms and circumstances of Ukrainian capitulation. 

▪️Zaluzhny-Klichko team is a more serious challenge. They appear to create a new party based on Klichko’s UDAR and popularity of Zaluzhny. They probably want to see Zelensky gone to improve management and coordination. Maybe it has something to do with rumors about Zelensky’s judgments being influenced by certain mind-altering substances and delaying many important decisions. 

The West won’t see them as notorious, in fact Klichko was one of the candidates for Ukrainian presidency and had a good chance to become one. Biden-Nuland team thought that he has too close ties with Germany and didn’t really want to share Ukraine with Merkel.  

Anyway, this team seems to be one of the worst choices for Russia. Despite well known blunders of Klichko, his team looks to be more competent than Zelensky’s team and Zaluzhny has support of the military. It could be not the worst choice after Ukrainian capitulation, but for now they are likely to extend the conflict even longer.

Finally come the oligarchs. Akhmetov did attack Zelensky accusing him of seizing power in Ukraine and turning it into dictatorship. However, this is more not about Zelensky but about Kolomoisky seeking to change the balance of power between Ukrainian oligarchs. Kolomoisky’s adversaries may help one of the other groups or create their own block, but it’s not a matter of short time.

Anyway, we finally see some internal disagreement within Ukraine. This is probably a sign that they see the victory of Russia as inevitable and are preparing to the inevitable redistribution of power after defeat. Zelensky still has some use as a fund-raiser so direct coup against him is unlikely.

Message,16634,1639836943,2022-12-09T12:31:14+00:00,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"❗️American journalist Deborah Armstrong known for her objective coverage of human rights violations in Donbass by Ukrainian government, support of Faina Savenkova and crusade against the infamous Mirotvorets website, has reported a first success –  UNICEF appears to have finally taken the additional step of making an actual statement to Ukraine, asking Kiev to take action to remove the names of minors from Mirotvorets. 

As reported by RIA Novosti on December 7, 2022, UNICEF’s statement came following a UN Security Council Meeting on Tuesday in which Russian Permanent Representative to the UN Vasily Nebenzya spoke about the 327 children whose names have been added to the notorious database. Nebenzya asked what UNICEF was doing about this and what the organization’s position was on the publication of children’s personal data on the internet.

For years, young Faina and others targeted by Mirotvorets have appealed to international human rights groups such as The Red Cross, UNICEF and other but all they have received in response was silence, or platitudes.

The notorious Mirotvorets database discloses the private data of those it targets such as their home addresses, phone numbers and other personal information. It includes the names of more than 100,000 people including hundreds of children like Faina Savenkova, a 14-year-old from Lugansk who was added to the hitlist after speaking before a UN Security Council at the age of 12. The youngest child added to the list is only 9 years old.

Mirotvorets website calls their searchable database “Purgatory”. In twisted minds of Ukrainian nationalists anyone named on this kill list, whether they are children from Donbass, journalists who write about Donbass, or dissidents not in lockstep with Kiev, are said to already be in “purgatory”.

The very existence of such website and its endorsement and support by the government of Ukraine with eyes of the collective West conveniently looking elsewhere removes any questions about justification of Russian special military operation. Not only the Ukrainian regime has allowed this hit list to exist, but it integrated it into government structures as a part of Center for Countering Disinformation (CCD) of Ukraine’s Security and Defense Council. 

Taking international action against such a notorious directory endorsing murders and using neural recognition systems to help Nazis find potential victims was long due. However, it may be not a coincidence that UN structures finally took some action, and the core reason for it is likely not Nebenzya’s speech. 

❗️It is quite possible that the story is more interesting. Looks like the founder of Mirotvorets Roman Zaitsev has some kind of disagreement with Vladimir Zelensky and in the end of November he did criticize the Ukrainian president calling him a liar with hands and wallet full of blood and virtually accusing him of treason.

Spiders in a jar are starting to eat each other. Maybe it’s not long before we see Zelensky himself on Mirotvorets list and that would be a pleasant sight. Still, while in Ukraine nationalists could be preparing to turn Zelensky into a sacrificial lamb, in the West he is still seen as the face of Ukraine and his words weigh much more.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,5082.0,31.0,2022-12-09T12:31:38+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,2.0,20.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,22.0,17.0,MessageEntityBold,22.0,17.0,MessageEntityUnderline,22.0,17.0,MessageEntityBold,39.0,386.0,MessageEntityBold,1229.0,219.0,MessageEntityBold,1509.0,63.0,MessageEntityBold,2576.0,327.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,491.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,491.0,,,,,MessageReplies,3.0,25478.0,False,[],,16716.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After almost a year of silence the former Frau Kanzler started talking to media and made a number of sensational statements in last couple months. Now she is just Frau Merkel and has shared many things that bring a very different light on some events of the not so recent past, especially Ukrainian crisis.

▪️On December 7th she talked to Die Zeit and said the following thing:

“I considered the initiation of Ukraine and Georgia's accession to NATO, which was discussed in 2008, to be wrong. The countries did not have the necessary prerequisites for this, nor did it think through to the end what consequences such a decision would have had, both with regard to Russia's actions against Georgia and Ukraine and to NATO and its rules of assistance. And the 2014 Minsk agreement was an attempt to give Ukraine time. Ukraine used this time to become stronger, as you can see today. The Ukraine of 2014/15 is not the Ukraine of today. Look how it took part in the battle for Debaltsevo. In early 2015, [Vladimir] Putin could easily have overrun them. And I doubt very much that the NATO states could have done as much then as they do today to help Ukraine…

…But I will tell you a point that concerns me. It has to do with the fact that the Cold War never really ended, because Russia was basically not pacified. When Putin invaded Crimea in 2014, he was expelled from the G8. NATO has also stationed troops in the Baltic states to show that we as NATO are ready for defense”.

▪️Effectively this means: 

🢚 NATO was just a bait for Ukraine and Georgia

🢚 Minsk agreements was just an attempt to “give Ukraine time” that it used to “become stronger”

🢚 If Russia started special operation back in 2014-2015, it would win and NATO would not be able to help Ukraine as much as it does now

🢚 She shares the view of the collective West that Russia was defeated in the Cold War but was not “pacified”. Interesting, what does she mean by “pacification”. 

Well, good to know that Minsk Agreements were just an excuse to delay open conflict, arm Ukraine and prepare it for war with Russia. Poroshenko has already confirmed it and now it is confirmed by a supposed guarantor of these agreements. Should we wonder that they were never implemented? 

Sad to see that Russian diplomats believed in good intentions of the opposite side, probably fooled by rather good relations and strong ties between Russia and Germany with France. There was quite strong support of military aid to Donbass in Russia back then and a half of Ukraine was not yet fully brainwashed with nationalist propaganda and was actually waiting for Russian liberators. 

Hopefully, this revelation will show that there can be no temporary agreements with Kiev, even with Western guarantors. Only permanent solution, only immediate actions.

Myths of immense capacities of U.S. military industrial complex turned out to be somewhat exaggerated. As it turns out, their existing capacities are not sufficient to sustain the Ukrainian army for much longer and they can potentially crank up production to the required level only in 2025.

▪️ While in times of World War 2 and even the Cold War U.S. arms industry was working on very different principles. It was a largely state-subsidized industry that was not that much profit-oriented and that used traditional methods prioritizing production capacity. In last decade of the 20th century most of these enterprises switched to “efficiency theories” that were borrowed by the West from Japan, such as Kaizen, Six Sigma, etc. 

Efficient production means that you produce only what you can sell and you cut down costs of maintenance of industrial facilities and equipment that you don’t need. Cutting down costs and avoiding excessive production is the way to achieve biggest profits. You can produce a bit more counting on future projections, but you will not produce ten times more than you need. 

▪️ Besides, in recent decades most orders to American military industrial complex were about the need to support overseas operations of US military and this involved specific orders for many specific types of weapons that were good for expedition forces but are not suitable for a conflict like Ukrainian. 

While U.S. military industrial complex is tightly integrated, it consists of hundreds and thousands of companies and virtually all complex items of weaponry and equipment require cooperation of many entities. It means that when U.S. faced the need to arm Ukraine, it could not just go and start production. 

They needed to place orders, run tenders, select suppliers. Then those suppliers had to return their old manufacturing equipment to service or build new facilities and production lines, find suppliers of components, and so on, and so on. Effectively the U.S. has to create many production facilities from scratch and with unclear prospects of their future use.

▪️ Some articles such as HIMARS units and missiles will still be in demand after the Ukrainian conflict ends, but items like Javelins and Stingers are already quite obsolete and it is unlikely that they will be needed anywhere else.

So, while the U.S. military industrial complex enjoys the allocated money and prepares to ramp up production in next couple years, they cannot but think about possible futility of their work if the conflict ends before that.

❗️By the way, those multi-billion numbers of military aid to Ukraine are not so real and not so huge as it seems. The thing is that they are accounting this aid at sale prices. Production costs and sales price are very different. 

US budget pays US military factories and defense contractors their sale price instead of covering their costs of production. Of course, Ukraine will cover the sales price or rather the West will try using frozen Russian assets to cover the sales price if the conflict will end with anything but Russian victory.

What does it all mean for Russia? It’s not worth underestimating the enemy. However, as U.S. industrial capacity will be fully deployed only around 2024-2025, Russia must use the remaining time window to end the conflict in its favor.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1851.0,1.0,2022-12-06T13:43:34+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,53.0,MessageEntityBold,159.0,190.0,MessageEntityBold,465.0,148.0,MessageEntityBold,688.0,22.0,MessageEntityBold,761.0,17.0,MessageEntityBold,787.0,20.0,MessageEntityBold,1163.0,305.0,MessageEntityBold,1676.0,101.0,MessageEntityBold,2601.0,230.0,MessageEntityBold,3177.0,41.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,482.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,482.0,,,,,MessageReplies,1.0,25478.0,False,[],,16564.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The collective West actively condemns Russia for attacks on dual-purpose infrastructure and ignores the fact that all those attacks can be easily stopped by Ukrainian side accepting Russian terms. 

It looks like they have forgotten not so distant past when NATO itself was waging a war in Europe using this kind of tactics from the very beginning. Here is an excerpt from the transcript of NATO Press Conference dated May 25, 1999.

• Norwegian News Agency: I am sorry Jamie but if you say that the Army has a lot of back-up generators, why are you depriving 70% of the country of not only electricity, but also water supply, if he has so much back-up electricity that he can use because you say you are only targeting military targets?

• Jamie Shea, NATO spokesman: Yes, I'm afraid electricity also drives command and control systems. If President Milosevic really wants all of his population to have water and electricity all he has to do is accept NATO's five conditions and we will stop this campaign. But as long as he doesn't do so we will continue to attack those targets which provide the electricity for his armed forces. If that has civilian consequences, it's for him to deal with but that water, that electricity is turned back on for the people of Serbia. Unfortunately, it has been turned off for good or at least for a long, long time for all of those 1.6 million Kosovar Albanians who have been driven from their homes and who have suffered, not inconvenience, but suffered in many cases permanent damage to their lives. Now that may not be a distinction that everybody likes but for me that distinction is fundamental.

⏱ In 1999, NATO was doing exactly the same thing that Russia is doing and they were doing it from the very beginning of that campaign. At least, back then they were a bit less hypocritical and openly spoke of their objectives and things they were doing. Now they would probably say that it’s Milosevic shelling his own energy infrastructure.

▶️ So what changes, if we replace Serbia with Ukraine and Milosevic with Zelensky? The reasoning is the same and the Kosovo precedent is sufficient to refute any accusations that NATO hypocrites are spitting at Russia. 

When Kiev regime was cutting off electricity to Crimea, when they stopped water supply to the peninsula, when they were continuously shelling Donbass destroying a large part of its infrastructure, did they care about millions of people living there? 

Using their own words, people of Donbass and Crimea have suffered in many cases permanent damage to their lives, millions of people had to escape from Donbass to Russia just to survive. Those Ukrainians that are now suffering difficulties failed to understand what Crimean and Donetsk people had to go through with their silent approval. 

⏱ Back then, Milosevic chose to spare his people and accepted NATO’s conditions although his army was still intact and able to fight. It was a hard choice but he did make it. 

However, it is unlikely that Vladimir Zelensky will follow the example. He is not an independent statesman looking for the good of his country but just a western puppet with hollow soul. He will sacrifice all Ukrainians without blinking an eye and will do anything to avoid justice and rightful retribution.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2097.0,10.0,2022-12-01T12:24:20+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,2.0,250.0,MessageEntityBold,686.0,24.0,MessageEntityBold,991.0,29.0,MessageEntityBold,1893.0,7.0,MessageEntityBold,2234.0,82.0,MessageEntityBold,2455.0,252.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,472.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,472.0,,,,,MessageReplies,5.0,25478.0,False,[],,16433.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This time the article speaks about alleged “Russian war crimes” the city of Kherson. However, this time it looks like they didn’t do their job well or no longer care what their audience will think.

➖Putting aside general hate tone, quotation of Ukrainian officials and references to previous fake stories such as Bucha, the article tells readers about two cases. Here are the stories that they provide as a proof of Russian atrocities.

➖One of the stories does not have any solid facts. It is a testimony of a woman who lived near local dump site and claims to “smell burnt bodies” some time in summer. Allegedly, her claim was confirmed by some other people living nearby. Journalists made very far-fetched conclusions that it were Russian soldiers burning their fallen comrades to cover up losses. This story doesn’t even need to be debunked.
The second story is about a young man from Kiev who came to Kherson region to check his father with whom he stayed in touch until the beginning of November. Although the young man asked his father to join him in Kiev, the old man refused — he was a farmer and said that he just wanted to tend for his field.

➖On November 10th the father’s phone stopped responding and the man went there to see what happened. It took him three days to arrive to the village where his father lived. 

➖When young man got to his family home, he found Ukrainian soldiers living there. He asked them where his father was. They shrugged their shoulders, and pointed to what appeared to be a makeshift grave with a cross in front of the house directly across the street. However, they didn’t allow him to check the grave and he had to wait for 10 days — first for deminers, then for police. They found bodies of his father and his grandmother, apparently shot. End of story. 
Now, let’s look at this story again. Something doesn’t make up, right? 

➖Firstly, last time the man heard about his father was November 10th, when Russian forces have been completing their evacuation. It is highly unlikely that any of them was present at some village at the very last minutes before evacuation, they were probably quite busy with other things. 

➖Second, the man found Ukrainian soldiers living in his family home and his family shot dead. He wasn’t even allowed to see their bodies immediately and had to deal with the version provided by AFU police. Again, the story ends here. 

❓I wonder if editorial board of New York Times, once a reputable newspaper, really thinks that its readers are idiots and will not question conclusions of journalists from this terrible story.
However, credibility has never been the strong side of Ukrainian regime’s narrative that is full of lies, fakes and blaming others for their own crimes.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2264.0,2.0,2022-11-29T14:41:20+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,468.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,468.0,,,,,MessageReplies,5.0,25478.0,False,[],,16782.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His article published in the Hill is titled “Republican establishment to conservative and faith-based voters: ‘Drop dead’” 

➖ The author points that many conservatives and people of faith have felt for many years that the entrenched Republican establishment and GOP “leadership” continually conveys the same message when it comes to the party following up on campaign promises made to those voting blocs. 

➖Once reelected, and often because of conservative and faith-based voters, those establishment Republicans and their leadership would stab those constituencies in the back as they cozied up to corporate America, lobbying firms, Big Tech, the mainstream media, and any special interests who might fund their campaigns or hire them once they left Congress. This is surprisingly fair estimation of internal U.S. politics and it’s worth adding that this is not limited to Republican party. Electoral promises often remain just promises. Less than a month has passed since the end of Congress elections campaign and people still remember GOP promises to end funding of Ukraine regime and hold Biden accountable for it.

☝️While funding has been left untouched, there are some initiatives to investigate controversial activities of President Biden and his family in last 20 years, and we may even see some progress with this investigation as Biden’s corrupt ties are quite obvious and this is especially true about his ties with Ukraine. 

Then Vice President, Joseph Biden was one of the orchestrators of the Maidan coup and it looks like that he or members of his family were rewarded by triumphant rebels with profitable positions in Ukrainian oil & gas sector. Burisma case is only tip of the iceberg. 

🗣 As top supporter of Ukrainian regime in U.S. administration, Biden enjoyed almost absolute power over the country. “‘Petro, you’re not getting your billion dollars,’” Biden recalled telling the president in an interview with the Atlantic. “‘It’s OK, you can keep the prosecutor general. Just understand—we’re not paying if you do.’”

❓Considering these strong ties of U.S. President with Ukraine and its administration and his influence on those, the role of Biden in escalation and continuation of the Ukrainian conflict is indeed worth investigation. Was he helping his proteges possibly fearing disclosure of some information? Why did the U.S. get involved in this conflict almost directly instead of taking neutral position? Where did those 100+ billions of financial and military aid to Ukraine end? 

➖However, as the Republicans got their seats, they are likely to forget their promises. Of course, it is too early to judge, but it looks like there will be no sensations. Republicans will assign an “audit committee” that won’t find anything in Ukraine’s black hole, Biden will be subject to token investigation and that’s it. 

➖Have Republicans fulfilled their electoral promises and stopped funding Ukraine, the conflict would have ended. However, it seems they value GOP’s sponsors from the arms industry more than will of American people that they are supposed to represent.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2108.0,3.0,2022-11-29T12:58:23+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,216.0,78.0,MessageEntityItalic,2000.0,48.0,MessageEntityItalic,2123.0,96.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,467.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,467.0,,,,,MessageReplies,4.0,25478.0,False,[],,16364.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

🗣 “Russia will not declare Ukraine a terrorist state, terrorist regime or a state sponsor of terrorism”, said Oleg Syromolotov, deputy foreign minister of Russia. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stressed that Russia will not resort to illegitimate approaches and won’t follow examples of those violating international laws, stating that the practice of labeling is used by the collective West headed by the U.S.A.

☝️While it is true that the collective West follows these practices as proven by recent Europarliament resolution (don’t miss Mick Wallace’s speech on the issue, he basically says it all), is there really any reason for Russia not to follow this example? 

➖Russia has already proven involvement of Ukrainian state in numerous terrorist attacks in Donbass region in 2014-2022 and Ukraine does not deny its accomplice in assassination of many legendary rebel leaders. Russia has already proven involvement of Ukrainian state in assassination of Daria Dugina and Crimean Bridge explosion that were officially classified as acts of terror. 

❓What about activity of Ukraine Security Service in Russia that uses social media to get personal data of Russian soldiers? They contact their families and con them into sending just one message to active phone number of the enlisted. And then a missile strike comes. 
Continuing attacks on Donbass civilians, brutal murder of POWs and acts of genocide in Kherson and other areas “liberated” by AFU should be enough to substantiate any “labels”. They are killing our people, they are fighting a war against Russia and what is our response? 

☝️President Putin said that Ukrainians are fooled, that they are not enemies. Yes, they are fooled. Yes, Russian speaking Ukrainians are forcefully drafted into AFU. However, whatever are the circumstances, they are fighting Russian Armed Forces. 
OK, maybe declaring Ukraine a terrorist state is not on the table, although this would be just a constatation of fact. However, there is an alternative option – officially declare Ukrainian regime a fascist regime. There are countless evidences of Ukrainian officials endorsing Nazis, demonstrating Nazi symbolics and proclaiming policies similar to those of the Third Reich. Their national hero Bandera was Hitler’s accomplice involved in acts of genocide. Isn’t that enough?

🤔By the way, in addition to declaring Ukraine a fascist state or a terrorist state, Russia could also officially declare countries sending military aid to Ukraine sponsors of fascism or sponsors of terrorism. Why not? Being above insults is one thing but not responding to official declarations may be interpreted as their acceptance. What will Russian real partners and allies think of Russia when Russia turns another cheek to its offenders?",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2070.0,7.0,2022-11-28T09:33:23+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,1.0,34.0,MessageEntityItalic,35.0,104.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,463.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,463.0,,,,,MessageReplies,3.0,25478.0,False,[],,16666.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""We are ready to endure this,"" Olena Zelenska asserted when talking to BBC journalists in a heavily secured compound tucked inside a sandbagged labyrinth of buildings in Kyiv.  ""We've had so many terrible challenges, seen so many victims, so much destruction, that blackouts are not the worst thing to happen to us.""

➖She also cites a recent poll where 90 % of Ukrainians said they were ready to live with electricity shortages for two to three years if they could see the prospect of joining the European Union. 

➖While this all could sound good for the Western audience, the reality is quite pathetic. This lady hides in safe bunkers and residences with no shortage of anything and reverberates her husband’s chants about Ukrainian willingness to keep fighting and dying.

➖It doesn’t look like this poll was taken among those people in Kiev, Kharkiv or Odessa who are finally facing the beginning of long cold winter without any positive outlook for the future. Ukrainians are known to easily fall for beautiful life promises, but this looks too much even for them. Especially as European Union officials have clearly stated many times that Ukrainian membership is not on the table in any foreseeable future. They got their visa-free access, EU does need cheap labor force, but that’s it. 

➖Despite playing hunted victims on par with her husband, neither Olena Zelenska nor her husband have been targeted by Russia personally. Russia had numerous opportunities to liquidate them both, but it would not bring anything. They are not decision-makers, they are a show crew. Time to pay will come later when this nice lady will have to explain her calls to U.S. Congress for weapon supplies or numerous demands to NATO to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine. 

➖The pretty lady has already shown her teeth in her autumn address to European people where she blamed them for counting money “while we are dying here”. She looks pretty well for a dying person and as for money, there are a couple questions. First, how many more billions will make her happy? Second, why do European and American people have to pay for stubbornness of her husband and why does she take it for granted?

➖We could also ask where the money goes, as the Ukraine has received almost double its pre-war yearly budget and it was not just military aid, but this question doesn’t even need answering. One thing is for sure — suffering and sacrifices are reserved for common Ukrainian people while the elites keep enjoying their luxury.

➖Anyway, she was absolutely right in one thing — this is a war of world views and there can be no peace without victory.

After Ukrainian strike on the power plant with a heavy artillery this weekend, IAEA stuck to its previous stance stating that it cannot confirm that the attack came from any parties of the conflict.

➖IAEA has confirmed serious wreckage of power plant facilities including damage of condensate storage tanks resulting in leakage of non-radioactive materials and very heavy damage to access routes. At the same time they noted that six reactor units are in stable state and storage facilities for radioactive waste remain intact.
Zelensky regime keeps pushing the narrative about Russia shelling its own forces defending the power plant and demanding UN to establish a demilitarized zone around the plant. While the reactors are already shut down and the level of risk to them is low, Russia is worried about hazard posed by potential hits to radioactive waste. 

❗️Russian nuclear energy experts have proposed evacuation of all hazardous components and materials to Russia. This proposal is indeed feasible as it will reduce the risks of nuclear incidents and will probably stop Ukrainian shelling aimed to cause such incident and put the blame on Russia.

☝️There also are indications that Zaporozhye nuclear plant is not the only potential target of Ukrainian provocations. On Tuesday British newspaper headline was saying that “Russia is planning false flag terror attack on Belarus nuclear power plant which it would blame on NATO or Ukraine”. 

➖We know that Russian attack on Belarus is absolutely out of question. We know that nuclear incident at BelAES, which was named as “potential target”, can cause huge damage to lands of Belarus and Russia and possibly Poland and Lithuania. 

➖We know that the United Kingdom has been continuously propping up Ukrainian war effort and provided full media support to Kiev regime. We know that when Ukraine starts speaking of “false flags”, it means that they are planning a provocation, another nasty trick that will keep them in center of attention despite widespread Ukraine fatigue in the collective West. 

➖British articles cites intelligence agency of Ukrainian ministry of defense as its source, so it is definitely worth to increase security level on Belarussian power plant and make sure that it is well defended against potential air strikes and terrorist attacks.

➖It is astonishing how can the Western public be so gullible to believe in such blatant lies and not to demand their governments to stop supporting criminal regime that openly blackmails Europe with nuclear catastrophe.

Starting from October 10th, Russian Armed Forces are launching almost daily strikes over power grid infrastructure, defense industry facilities, military command facilities and communication infrastructure over the entire Ukraine. 

➖Ukraine national energy company warns all regions about unplanned energy outages in addition to planned shutdowns. Many regions have no power available for more than half of the day. Additional Russian strikes on gas infrastructure and fuel storage facilities make use of portable generators problematic in the environment of fuel deficit. 

❗️Fuel prices have almost doubled since February. Panic buying, limited supplies and army needs push prices up every day. It is already likely that a fuel crisis will follow soon as Ukrainian refineries have been in poor shape even before 2022 and some of them have been seriously damaged by missile strikes. It’s a matter of short time when Kiev government will have to choose between military and civilian supplies.

➖With energy collapse of Ukraine becoming imminent, some regions receive better treatment than the others. People of Odessa have already noted that Ukrainian energy authorities favor western Ukrainian cities such as Lviv at the cost of Odessa, Nikolaev and other Russian-speaking cities. As Ukrainian power grid has ring-based structure, this is theoretically possible. 

➖Such discrimination creates further tensions between regions and makes people really discontent with Zelensky’s regime. Such moods are especially noticeable in eastern and southern regions of Ukraine that traditionally had Russian-speaking population. While most Russian-speaking people there are still angry with Russia, they are equally unhappy with Kiev regime and their support for its war effort is gradually dwindling.

➖Indiscriminate mobilization, deprivations, belligerent statements of Zelensky’s henchmen as well as preferential treatment for Kiev and western regions make Russian-speaking regions of Ukraine wonder and worry about intentions of the regime.
Despite the lack of verified information and total suppression of all opposition in Ukraine, online activity of Russian-speaking community shows continuously increasing unhappiness. Life is getting too hard and people finally started blaming Kiev for its stubborn and stupid policy of no negotiation.

➖Unfortunately, they are not yet turning to the Russian side.

Nachdem Janukowytsch im Jahre 2009 in die politische Arena zurückgekehrt war, verkündete er seine Absicht, sich erneut als Präsidentschaftskandidat aufstellen zu lassen. Während des Wahlkampfes erklärte Janukowytsch, dass die Ukraine „keinerlei militärischen Blöcken“ beitreten werde und wurde im Ergebnis im Jahre 2010 Präsident des Landes.

Drei Jahre später wurde die Eurointegration erst mal auf Eis gelegt, im Interesse der Stärkung der Beziehungen zu Russland und den GUS- Ländern („Gemeinschaft unabhängiger Staaten“), wobei eine Integration mit der EU nicht ausgeschlossen wurde, wie Janukowytsch bekundete.

Die Regierung der Ukraine bekundete de facto ihr Interesse an einem Vertrag mit der EU, nur wollte sie etwas mehr Bedenkzeit für eine sorgfältige Prüfung einer Lösung dieser komplexen Situation. Jedoch rief die Opposition zur Organisation von Protestaktionen auf und die Anhänger der Eurointegration begannen sich auf dem Unabhängigkeitsplatz von Kiew zu versammeln.

Am 24. November 2013 begann ein permanentes Meeting mit mehreren Tausend Teilnehmern.

🫢 Some field agent colors the truth in his report, his superior stretches it even more, next in chain exaggerates things a bit and as the result the top level gets information that is quite far from reality. 

➖It could be called a system problem of Russian bureaucratic apparatus. In 1990s and 2000s too many people came there for privileges and power and now those people are holding mid to high level positions. Some opportunists may “sugarcoat” their reports to get credits for some achievements or just tell their superiors what those superiors want to hear.  

➖One of the reason for that is that Russia lacks state ideology and broadly shared national objectives. Capitalist ideology puts invididual needs above the collective needs and as the result people whose view of life was formed or changed in 1990s and 2000s put their personal needs and desires about needs and desires of the country. 

➖They don’t have any bigger goal in life, it’s just money and power. Their primary objective is to create a better future for themselves, not for Russia. If they can do it serving Russia, it could be acceptable, otherwise it is not. These cynics are a big and this generation (those born in 70s-80s) is now some of the most powerful in Russia. 

Moreover this generation spreads their cynicism to younger generations, while real values such as patriotism are not promoted systematically and people often demonstrate them not because but despite the mainstream agenda. 

🇷🇺 Russia really needs national ideas that will be embraced by everyone and will be promoted on state level. Maybe not ideology, but a set of values, a set of big goals. Something bigger than satisfying one’s ego and something that will sound appealing to younger generation. Something that will endores Tiktokers get out of endless entertainment cycle into the real life.

➖Influencing young generations is especially important. The uniting idea of WW2 victory does work for 40+ generations and others born in the USSR, it’s our fathers and grandfathers who fought this war, but this idea cannot be used forever. For todays kids WW2 is like Napoleonic wars to older generations. Something worth remembering but it’s rather a memory of the glorious past, not a beacon for glorious future.

🗣 Russian Duma speaker Volodin stated that 2014 coup d’etat in Ukraine have resulted in complete loss of sovereignty of the country. Before 2022 its budget deficit was almost 40% covered by foreign loans and credits. Next year deficit will amount 58%

“Kiev is spending over a half of its income on loan payments and is forced to take new credits. Kiev tries to conceal it, but the problem is obvious. Zelensky has stolen future of Ukrainian people selling the country to debt slavery”

☝️ In 1990 Ukrainian GDP was $90.3 billion exceeding GDP of countries like Hungary, Poland and Bulgaria. Russia took all USSR’s debt and Ukraine became an independent state, a country without debts. Ukraine inherited about one third of all Soviet space industry, aviation industry, ship building industry and had really huge industrial capacity at the onset of its existence. 

➖ There was a good reason why Yanukovich’s government refused to sign the EU association agreement. According to Prime Minister Azarov, Ukraine would need about 160-170 billion euros in ten years only to adapt technical regulations for EU standards as a part of the association agreement. That was about three yearly budgets of Ukraine and almost ten times its national debt by the period. 

❗️In June 2022 Ukraine’s debt reached historic record of $94 billion. Considering continued fall of hryvna and chronic budget deficit of Ukraine amplified by military expenses, Ukraine is unable to sustain its own economy without resorting to foreign financial aid, which also often takes the form of debt. 

➖European countries and the U.S. are no longer willing to give “free” financial and military aid to Ukraine. What does it mean? It means inevitable default and bankruptcy of Ukraine. Nobody will give them anything for free. While Ukraine is already doomed, this does not apply to its regions. Crimea, Donbass, Kherson and Zaporozhye are not going to pay debts made by Zelensky’s regime and its predecessors.

 🔷Russian Ministry of Defense justifies it with its desire to avoid inevitable losses if it tried to hold the city. However, this point is what worries a lot of Russians, especially Russians in new territories. In fact, Russia did concede a Russian city without even trying to hold it. If it was formally Ukrainian, it would be much less of a problem.
There are many versions of possible reasons for that decision, there are many rumors in the air.

🔷However, it’s anyway a big PR loss and a big hit on government ratings. Referendum did changed things and the order for retreat does undermine the results of this referendum. Moreover, the very objective of running the referendum so early was to assure the people of new regions that Russia will defend them. Yes, civilians were evacuated from Kherson, but this still doesn’t look good considering the above objective.

🔷Nevertheless, there is no reason for Russians to panic or accuse the government of deliberate concessions. The decision was well thought and we’ll eventually see that it was wise. If we put PR aside, it makes perfect sense from military point of view. Russia stabilizes the front and stops Ukrainian offensive freeing its own forces to be used in other areas. Russia is still winning the war of attrition and still has good chances to see Ukrainian capitulation without taking heavy losses in manpower.   

🔷Saving lives of Russian soldiers is indeed a good purpose and a good reason for retreat. Slowly advancing Ukrainian forces greatly outnumbered Russian defenders in Kherson and their artillery was able to hit Russian supply routes. It wasn’t worth sacrificing soldiers for a city that couldn’t be held risking total cut-off and destruction of the entire defending force. Russia is not Ukraine and is not abandoning its fighters to die. 

 🔷Unfortunately, retreat inevitably means that any people who refused evacuation from Kherson are likely to become victims of war crimes by Ukrainian nationalists. We can expect more mass murders and attempts to frame Russia in further attempts to promote the cause of Kiev regime.
For now, Russians just have to wait a little more. New troops will arrive to the front, forces from Kherson will regroup to other areas and inevitable Russian counteroffensive will follow. Meanwhile, continued missile strikes will disrupt Ukrainian supplies and their ability to move troops, while their sponsors will come back in another month demanding for more success.

🔷This is not over. Kiev government will not negotiate a ceasefire or truce and treaty unless pushed by the U.S., but the U.S. seems to be fine with the way things are going and will literally fight Russia to the last Ukrainian. Only physical destruction of Ukrainian ability to fight will bring some decisive results and may force the other side to talk.  

 🔷So yes, it was a hard decision and undeniable loss of face for Russia. However, Russians don’t say farewell to Kherson, they just say “See you later”",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2269.0,7.0,2022-11-14T08:24:48+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,118.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,425.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,425.0,,,,,MessageReplies,36.0,25478.0,False,[],,15569.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

🇺🇸November elections in the U.S. are already over and although it seems that Republican did win majority in Congress, it was not an overwhelming victory or expected “red wave”. The Senate breakdown is unclear and it is quite likely that Democratic party will maintain their control. How will these results impact the Ukrainian conflict?

🔷Despite some Republican slogans about ending U.S. military and financial aid to Ukraine, Russia had no high hopes about the results of the elections. Some signs indicate that Russia did favor the Republicans this time and even withheld announcement of withdrawal from Kherson city in Ukraine until the voting ended.

🔷Nonetheless, Russia knows that the majority of U.S. Republicans just as the majority of U.S. Democrats are not Russian friends and will not do anything that will look as a favor to Russia. U.S. support to Ukraine depends more on physical constraints and situation in U.S. economy than on the party controlling the House. 

🔷If any changes are expected about U.S. aid to Ukraine, those are changes about accountability. Both Republicans and Democrats are concerned about rumors of U.S.-supplied weapons ending on black market and on very high level of corruption in the AFU. 

🔷According to recent reports, the U.S. are now planning to supply Ukraine with some older stocked weaponry because they are out of reserve stock for newer models and are not able to replenish this stock quickly and provide the necessary ammunition, production ramp will take from 1 to 3 years. 

🔷That said, with Ukrainian counter-offensive soon to be stalled on the Dnieper and stabilization of the front line, further development of the situation will depend on Russian ability to disable enemy equipment. Neither Europe, nor the U.S. are willing to make their industry work solely to supply Ukraine and Ukrainian army. Ukraine’s own arms industry has very limited capacity and is mostly used to repair damaged tanks and vehicles. 

🔷This means that at some point of time foreign sponsors will no longer be able to replenish Ukraine’s losses, be it U.S. Republicans, U.S. Democrats or whoever else. The only thing Russia has to do is to outlast Ukraine and win the war of attrition and it looks like this is the tactics chosen by the Russian Ministry of Defense for this very reason.

🔷While the issue with military aid is clear, the issue with financial aid is still on the table. Ukrainian budget deficit is counted in billions, Ukraine’s chances to repay debts are very slim and the U.S. are not a charity fund.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2085.0,2.0,2022-11-11T15:09:11+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,48.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,424.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,424.0,,,,,MessageReplies,4.0,25478.0,False,[],,14820.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

🔷On November 9th Russian Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu has ordered Russian forces to retreat from the city of Kherson to prepared defense positions on the left coast of Dnieper. The Minister said that life and health of Russian servicemen are always a priority.

🔷This order followed report of General Surovikin who stated that while Russian Armed Forces successfully repeal all Ukrainian attempts of offensive in the area and have inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy, AFU keep launching strikes on schools, hospitals and civilian population of Kherson, which is currently being evacuated across the Dnieper. Surovikin stated that all civilians willing to evacuate have been evacuated and over 115,000 citizens have been transported to safety.

❓What will this mean to the course of special operation? From military point of view it will stabilize the front line and allow Russian forces to concentrate on other areas avoiding losses in an attempt to hold Kherson with supply lines across the Dnieper being in the range of Ukrainian artillery. 

☝️From PR point of view this retreat poses a serious problem. It is going to become a media victory for Ukraine. Although this retreat was not forced and is not a result of any military defeat, the West will surely present it as a big victory for Ukraine and will demonstrate Ukrainian sponsors that their money is not being spent in vain. It is unlikely that it will work for long, but Ukraine will try to use it as much as possible.

🔷However, this should not be viewed as a defeat or a turn of the tide. While media victories are important, real victories are awaiting on the ground and inevitable Russian counter-offensive will put everything in place. General Surovikin has also reported about successful activity in Donbass and advances in this area are surely be more important.

🔷It's easier to understand the decision of the Ministry of Defense looking at a broader scale. Ukraine is currently way overstretched and depends solely on support of the West and especially the U.S. With certain Republican victory on mid-terms it is very likely that this support will be reduced no matter what happens on the ground. 

🔷In addition to that, Russian missile strikes are slowly and steadily disabling Ukrainian energy grid and if they continue at the same rate, the grid will suffer irreparable damage resulting in total blackout in a matter of weeks. This blackout would cause in total chaos and inevitable collapse of the frontline defenses.  

🔷Russian missile strikes also damage Ukrainian air defenses and ammunition storage facilities. When Ukrainian air defense falls below critical level, Russian Air Force will totally dominate Ukrainian skies without any opposition. When Ukrainian forces run out of sophisticated ammunition, they won’t be able to continue any resistance. 

🔷In view of all those weak points of Ukraine, it is indeed not reasonable to suffer heavy losses trying to hold one city despite all its importance and symbolical value.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2046.0,3.0,2022-11-11T11:12:34+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,20.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,422.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,422.0,,,,,MessageReplies,6.0,25478.0,False,[],,15570.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

🇩🇪While German government keeps treading in toe with the U.S. on its relationship with Russia, public moods in Germany are gradually changing. 

🙅‍♂️Germany has already seen a number of protests against EU sanctions on Russia like the one in Dresden on October 30th. Those thousands of Germans don’t want to starve or freeze for Ukrainian President Zelensky’s war that was provoked and engaged in by the U.S.A., E.U. and NATO. As Germany and Europe feel the pain of increasingly economic hardship, German and other European governments may finally start listening to public opinion and succumb to the pressure of their people.

▫️Following Nord Stream attack staged by the U.K. and the U.S. German leader has already showed some spine against Joe Biden. While he is still too scared of making peace with Russia, he went openly defying Biden as far as China is concerned. 

▫️Nord Stream was damaged but when the truth was uncovered the outcome turned favorable for Russia and China. France’s Macron is openly speaking against US charging $1320 for the same gas that was charged $300 by Russia and Scholz sold a 25% stake of Hamburg Port to a Chinese company.

▫️Scholz literally braved all opposition by Blinken and his own minister Habeck and went to China against all odds. He went with many companies for a lot of business discussions. Scholz had refused the offer of President Macron to join him and present a common European approach in his recent visit to Beijing.

▫️Although Scholz was not very well received in China, it’s worth noting that he told Xi Jingping to call on Putin to have a ceasefire on Ukraine. While it looks routine, in fact it means that a European leader asks Chinese leader to help establish peace ignoring the U.S. role completely. That’s an unimaginable loss of face for the U.S. from Chinese point of view.

▫️So, while Europe is not turning to Russia, there is some chance that Europe will turn away from U.S. and to the Eurasian initiatives. The other alternative is becoming economic slaves to U.S. oil companies as per our previous material. 

▫️The world is indeed on the brink of radical changes and maybe despite all their words, European leaders will see the choice that will be most beneficial for them. Economic slavery with America or mutual prosperity with China and Russia?

▫️Of course, these moods are not yet prevalent in Europe and many countries are firmly set against any compromises with Russia, but as Germany and France are questioning their allegiance to the U.S. changes are inevitable. 

▫️European Union we know will either transform to a colony of the United States or break apart and it may happen sooner than anyone could have expected.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2493.0,17.0,2022-11-10T18:58:17+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,2.0,33.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,421.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,421.0,,,,,MessageReplies,8.0,25478.0,False,[],,15571.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Western countries may send them some reserves but not the real thing they are using.

▫️As for Aspide, they are short-range systems developed about 50 years ago. Spanish army has both old and upgraded versions of those systems and it hasn’t been clarified whether Ukraine will receive Aspide 1985 or Aspide 2000. Regardless of that, Spain vouched to supply Ukraine only one battery with max. 25 km missile flight distance.

▫️In essence, it means that Ukraine just got a couple launchers that are not compatible with its main air defense system, which is based on S-300 batteries. It is also unclear whether Ukrainian military personnel is properly trained to operate these systems.

▫️Now comes the interesting part. According to estimates, back in April Ukraine had over a hundred of S-300 batteries, but many of those batteries have already been disabled by Russian missile strikes. The remaining batteries are the only shield that protects Ukraine from total Russian air domination. 

▫️However, Ukraine is not capable to produce or maintain S-300 batteries and S-300 missiles. Their stock is limited and Russian strikes on ammunition warehouses did a lot to deplete those stocks. When Ukraine inevitablу runs out of S-300 missiles, few Western batteries won’t be able to create a serious threat for Russian aircraft and Russia will fully control skies of Ukraine.

▫️There are so many thin points for Ukraine in this conflict and ammunition is one of those weak points. Western countries are almost out of their own stocks and even U.S. production capacity is not sufficient to replenish ammo than Ukraine uses every month. 

▫️Another weak point of new systems supplied by the West is that they are not so effective against smaller targets such as drones and are an easy prey for those. Of course, we have yet to see them in action, but something tells that Western countries will reconsider the idea of supplying air defense to Ukraine pretty soon.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2205.0,0.0,2022-11-10T11:46:32+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,420.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,420.0,,,,,MessageReplies,5.0,25478.0,False,[],,15572.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expected production volume of those facilities is sufficient to fully replace Russian gas supplies to Europe.  🔷Here comes the interesting part – these LNG facilities won’t be built a matter of no time, but in a period of 5-10 years, while the investments have already been allocated. This means that U.S. oil companies are absolutely confident that Europe will not return to Russian gas in mid-term perspective, or else they wouldn’t make such commitments.  ❓What do U.S. oil companies know that the general public does not? Looks like they either expect the Ukrainian conflict to run for many years or they expect Russian victory and preservation of anti-Russian sanctions. U.S. oil companies have been traditionally affiliated with the Republican party and the Republican party is now winning the midterms (which was expected when oil companies announced their plans).   🔷Whichever is the scenario they expect, it does not include Ukrainian victory or any other result that would be acceptable to collective West enough to lift sanctions from Russia. Good to know that they have seemingly dumped their plans to turn Russia into a resource colony.   🔷As for Europe, it seems that they are absolutely confident that Europeans will buy anything that US offers. Essentially it is so because Europe does not have any other choices other than the choice between US and Russia.   Scenario envisaged by U.S. oil companies implies that Europe will keep getting U.S. LNG, European industry will lose all its competitive advantages and won’t be able to compete with U.S. industry anywhere and European countries will largely depend on U.S. supplies to survive each and every year.  🙅‍♂️Europeans broke energy ties with Russia yelling about Russian potential to weaponize energy dependence of Europe and use it to influence European decisions. However, it looks like they have no worries about being even more dependent on the US and paying much more for it. European politicians seem to be OK with this change. The question is, will they convince the European people about it or will we see some changes?   ☝️Whatever will happen, Europe is facing hard times ahead. U.S. plants will be constructed and commissions only in 5-10 years and before that Europe will have to resort to drastic energy saving measures just to survive. Restoration of ties with Russia is the only way for them to avoid deep decline with inevitable collapse in not so distant future.  ❓Was support of neo-Nazi Ukrainian regime worth it?",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,15270.0,64.0,2022-11-09T13:11:59+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,46.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,417.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,417.0,,,,,MessageReplies,5.0,25478.0,False,[],,15574.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

➖As Ukrainian conflict rages on, Russian missile strikes continue to disrupt operation of Ukrainian energy grid. Every day there is air alert in at least several large cities if not all. Blackouts are becoming a common thing, people in Kiev has to spend from 5 to 10 hours without electricity. 

➖Ukraine’s president Zelensky ignores all Russian offers to return to negotiations and this means that these strikes will continue. European countries are helping Ukraine overcome the energy shortage, but it doesn’t really work. Total blackout is looming on the horizon and it is about to create one of the largest migration crisis in history.

➖Even Ukrainian government urges Ukrainians to leave the country. That’s yet another sign of failed state, but that’s another topic. Anyway, there are not many places where Ukrainians can go – it’s either Russia or the West. Despite all Western propaganda, millions of Ukrainians would still prefer Russia as they have friends and family ties there. However, it is unlikely that Ukrainian government will let them pass through the front lines unharmed or will let them ever come back. 
Therefore, all those millions of refugees are going West. Europe is already overwhelmed by Ukrainian refugees. Initially they were welcomed everywhere but as time passed, things started to change. In light of energy crisis European governments are encouraging all possible saving measures and subsidies to people hosting refugees are among those costs that can be cut down. 

➖The influx of Ukrainian migrants has already caused numerous problems. Ukrainians usually don’t speak languages of countries where they stay, they create extra burden on social security system of the host countries, they are trying to find jobs and work hard, but that is also not viewed very well. Energy crisis will inevitably increase the level of unemployment in Europe and locals won’t be happy about competition and dumping pressure from Ukrainians or anyone else.

➖The issue of housing is also pending. Very few Ukrainians managed to find any permanent place to live on their own, most are still using refugee camps or are hosted by hospitable Europeans. However, despite all this hospitability, this is not a permanent solution.

➖There will be problems even with the existing number of migrants, but if their number increases, the outcome will be catastrophic. Europe won’t be able to provide them normal living conditions, healthcare, schools, pensions, jobs. Even the richest countries such as UK, Germany and France are already facing budget problems because of energy crisis, inflation and numerous other issues. They are spending billions every month to subsidize housing, food, healthcare and schools for Ukrainian migrants, but those billions are needed elsewhere and, moreover, available resources are limited.

➖Zelensky is using the situation to blackmail Europeans demanding multi-billion subsidies and supply of energy and power grid equipment threatening to send more migrants across the border. Ukrainians don’t matter anything to him or his clique. Although Ukrainian nationalists are hysterical about their ethnic superiority, it seems they don’t mind if their people become nomads and will get involved in various unqualified if not criminal jobs in the “civilized West”.

➖ The longest period of peace in Europe lasted from 1945 to 1991 and was the accomplishment of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics that defeated Nazi Germany and established balance of power inside Europe. 

➖This power balance of bipolar world was the only thing that prevented open wars between countries – countries within one block wouldn’t fight each other and would avoid local violence because it could trigger interference of the other block. There were few really neutral states but as the blocks were constantly ready for war with each other, there was no war. 

➖The balance of power in Europe was destroyed in 1989-1991 with dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union. The Soviet side has voluntarily decided to stop confrontation and made a giant step to stable peace based not on mutual assured destruction but on trust and cooperation. However, the other side was not so noble and simply declared itself a winner and started enjoying the spoils. The balance of power shifted and the strongest side thought that it has a right to decide the issues of war, peace and the way that other countries should follow.

➖Now, which “every” nations have exactly signed for peace in Europe? NATO countries? The ones that bombed Yugoslavia, which is a European country just a bit over 20 years ago? It’s not that much. 20 years is not “lasting peace”. 

➖And Europe is more than just that. Is Artsakh not Europe? Is Armenia not Europe? What about Georgia? Some other continent? There have been no “peace in Europe” ever since the fall of the Warsaw pact. 

➖One more thing – why is Europe so special? Why should it be safe from conflicts? How is it better than the Middle East or Africa or Asia? Conflicts don’t come out of nowhere. They come when nations see no other options. Russians are doing what they have to do. They weren’t the one who started violence. Violence was started by Russian enemies and Russia is ending it.
By the way, the only continent that had internal peace like forever is Australia. Maybe Australian indigenous people would disagree, but we can’t ask Tasmanian people about it anymore. If this is the kind of peace Europe wants in Ukraine, we better have war.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2023.0,5.0,2022-11-07T14:55:28+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,151.0,39.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,412.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,412.0,,,,,MessageReplies,10.0,25478.0,False,[],,15579.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

➖This economic war was not declared by Russia, so Russia has not set any objectives for it. Europe did declare economic war on Russia that took the form of massive anti-Russian sanctions. When these sanctions were initially announced, their declared objectives were “to cripple Russian war machine and Russian economy making it impossible for Russia to continue military activities in Ukraine” and to “stimulate regime change in Russia”. 

➖So, since Russian economy is getting better every month and Russian defense industry is working three shifts with noticeably increased production volumes as compared to previous year, it does not look like this crippling objective has worked to any noticeable extent. Russian military is fully supplied and stocked with all necessary equipment and ammunitions, there have been no reports of any shortages. 

➖While the government appreciates support of volunteers and army support funds, it has several times announced that there is no need for any extra financial commitments by citizens or organizations. When several regions have proposed to cancel New Year celebrations and send saved money to the army, the Kremlin has officially stated that this should not be even considered. 

➖As time went by, Europeans have invented another objective — to get fully independent on Russian energy resources and substitute Russia with other suppliers. Despite the fact that Russia has been a stable and reliable supplier for many decades, Europeans decided to break those ties all at once. Even then, Russia did not terminate supplies immediately and is in fact supplying energy to Europe even now with some routes running through Ukraine.

➖Anyway, this objective has been virtually achieved. Europe is getting independent of Russian energy, Russian food and Russian everything. As for the costs and consequences… it doesn’t look like Europe ever thought about it. European governments are surely not going hungry, unlike their people.
Let’s take an example of the United Kingdom, which is one of the most active proponents of anti-Russian sentiments in Europe and is suspected of direct acts of sabotage against Russian and German infrastructure. 

➖According to latest data, 9.7 million adults and over 4 million children in the United Kingdom have experienced food poverty last month, which means they could not afford three meals a day.

I also can’t forget a BBC News 24 story on KFOR’s entry into Kosovo with Kate Adie presenting. They inadvertently filmed the KLA kidnapping Serbs, at the time I wasn’t sure what I was watching but stayed in the roadside café to watch it more than once as it never made sense, small numbers of civilians on the back of military trucks each with a KLA guard on the back watching over them as they drove toward the Macedonian/Albanian border, straight past a British light armoured brigade (why I’ve never been able to listen to James Blunt, I suspect it was his brigade that just waved them past). There was a teenage girl curiously looking out over the side of one of the trucks as crowds of Albanians were cheering the KFOR troops as they passed through a small town. She’s the reason I knew they were Serbs, her dress and her appearance, broke my heart finding out 8 years later (when Carla del Ponté went public) they were being kidnapped to Albania where they were kept in camps for months, blood matched for their organs, before being butchered while conscious. I spent hours at the BFI looking over old news stories from the time but BBC News 24 is not archived, although I saw a lot of other disturbing scenes. As a last resort I wrote to Kate Adie to try get a copy of the news story telling her I sought justice for the girl and the others, but she never replied. Just to narrow it down I did approach Channel 4, but they refused to search their archives for a specific date, when they found out what I was looking for.

➖The broad geopolitical objective of Russia is getting its rightful place in the emerging world order and to make sure that all countries in the world will benefit from it. The time of unipolar world is over and Russia has its own vision of the world that is yet to come. 

❗️Russian conflict is not with the West, Russia has no aim to destroy the West or change the Western way of life, their values. Russian aim is to preserve its own way of life and its own values and let other countries have their way.

☝️Vladimir Putin in his recent speech has stated new vision of reality:

“Collapse of the Soviet Union destroyed equilibrium between geopolitical forces. The West felt as a winner and proclaimed the unipolar world order where only its own will, culture and interests had the right to exist.
The historic period of total global domination of the West is coming to an end, unipolar world is becoming a thing of the past. We are standing on a historical boundary and the next decade will probably be the most dangerous, the most unpredictable and at the same time the most important decade since the end of the World War 2. The West is unable to control the humankind but desperately tries to do it, while most nations of the world no longer desire it. This is the main conflict of the new age. To quote classic words, we have a revolutionary situation: the top cannot and the bottom doesn’t want to live this way.
Russia is not challenging Western elites – Russia is simply defending its right of existence and free development. We are not going to become a new hegemon. Russia does not propose to replace unipolar world with bipolar, tripolar, etc. or replace domination of the West with domination of the East, the North or the South. This would inevitably bring us to a new dead end.”
No wonder, that Putin’s October speech was welcomed and highly acclaimed in most third world countries, while the West didn’t publicize it and made it go below the radar of mass media, which focused attention on other parts of his speech distorting them to vilify Russia. 
Russian geopolitical objective is freedom — freedom for Russia and any other country to develop in its own way without ideological or moral pressure of self-proclaimed global moral authorities. Economic and political independence are extremely important to avoid neocolonialism disguised as globalism, but ideological independence is the core and it should come first. 

🇷🇺 Russia agrees to respect values of others but it also demands respect to its own values. The attempt to shape the world by Western patterns has failed and time has come to create a better world based on mutual respect, cooperation and equality of all countries.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,11228.0,21.0,2022-11-03T08:30:30+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,1.0,75.0,MessageEntityBold,350.0,235.0,MessageEntityItalic,658.0,1857.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,398.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,398.0,,,,,MessageReplies,8.0,25478.0,False,[],,15585.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

👌 To some extent. It is quite possible that Western leaders think this way. They view this trade as a benefit. Maybe they could use this option as leverage in negotiations with Russia, but they can’t use this carrot to make Russia accept an ultimatum. 

➖Russian concerns still have to be addressed and a solution has to be developed for each of the four objectives that Russia has established for the special operation in Ukraine. 
Now, when dust has settled, Russians no longer think that trade with the West is a “carrot”, many view it as a “poison apple” that resulted in destruction of Russian industry. Resuming trade with the West looks an easy way to improve and grow Russian economy, but the easy way isn’t always the right way.

➖Looking at consequences of disruption of trade with Russia for the collective West, we could in fact say that it is Russia that could use “resuming trade” as a carrot to bring the West to negotiation table if Russians want it. 

➖While Russia sure had to deal with some problems as the result of sanctions and disruption of supply chains, it does not look like Russia is having any serious problems with its internal economy. Inflation has stabilized after a spike in the beginning of year and there are no shortages of any vital consumer goods. 
Russia has survived the most dangerous period of crisis and severance of economic ties with the West without noticeable losses. The bottom point is already behind us and things are getting better and better with every month. 

➖As for the West, it is not monolithic with this regard. While the United States did not have any serious problems because of breaking ties with Russia and even managed to capitalize on it, for Europe the situation is different. 

➖The United States are still facing an economy crisis and potential recession, but it has more to do with economic policies of the incumbent President than with anything that is going on in the Eastern hemisphere. The longer this situation lasts, the more American people want to see the government focus on internal problems instead of spending money somewhere on another side of the world. 

➖As for Europe, its economy was much more intertwined with Russian and severance of ties did create serious problems, which have not fully manifested yet. It turned out that while sheer volume of trade with Russia was not so high, it was import of Russian energy that made the wheels of European economy running. Without Russian supplies European industrial machine faced problems and those are not short-term problems that can be fixed with emergency measures but a critical issue that could result in total collapse of European industry. 

➖For now, Europe is just paying whatever it takes to keep things running. This is an emergency approach and it works to an extent unless another emergency happens. However, this is not a viable long-term solution because it undermines competitiveness of European industry and economy. Unlike Russia, Europe is not self-sufficient in terms on energy. 

🤔So, the West can offer Russia fancy brands and shiny stuff and Russia can offer the West much needed energy that is vital to make those shiny things.

Message,13509,1639836943,2022-10-27T17:52:45+00:00,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"🤔Why Russia says it is liberating Ukraine while Ukrainians fight Russia for their freedom?

⛔️ Ukraine is not fighting for its freedom. Ukraine is not an independent state to begin with. The status of Ukraine can be defined as a client state, a puppet state and/or a proxy colony. 

🔷 Client state is defined a country that gets support and protection from another larger and more powerful country. Ever since 2014 Ukraine has been a client state of the United States of America and to lesser extent the European Union, which itself can be considered a client entity of the U.S.A. Those entities provided Ukraine financial support in form of loans and protection in form of military aid. 

🔷 A note on client state status of the European Union. European Union does receive military support and military protection from the United States of America and hosts a large number of U.S. or U.S.-controlled military bases. Permanent presence of U.S. soldiers on European soil and especially in Germany causes doubts about the very status of EU as an independent entity.

🔷 A puppet state is a state with a government which is endowed with the outward symbols of authority but in which direction and control are exercised by another power. Ever since 2014 Ukraine has been puppet state of the United States of America. Natural interests of Ukrainian state have been ignored in favor of geopolitical interests of its puppeteer. 

🔷A proxy colony is a formally independent country that is directly or indirectly controlled by a stronger country for the sole benefit of the controller, usually economic benefit. Ukrainian economy was not in best state by the time of 2014 coup, but ever since that time Ukrainian government cared not about benefit of Ukrainian people but about profits of its hegemon and promoting its interests with the aim to create a military threat on Russian border and reduce the influence of the Russian Federation.

🔷 So, why are Ukrainians not fighting for their freedom? Because dependent country can fight for its freedom only against its master. A puppet state can fight for its freedom only when it fights against its puppeteer. If Ukrainians fought against NATO to throw them out of their country, they would really fight for the freedom of Ukraine. Instead, the puppet regime of Zelensky is fighting for the slavery of Ukraine, not for its freedom. Until Ukrainians return their independence, saying that they fight for freedom would be a mockery.
Ironically, while Ukrainians fight for continuing their own slavery, Russia fights for liberating them from their masters and their government puppets who have fooled a large part of Ukrainian people with propagandist lies and deliberately worked for years to bring the wedge between brotherly Russian and Ukrainian nations…",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2058.0,12.0,2022-10-27T18:03:05+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,92.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,384.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,384.0,,,,,MessageReplies,4.0,25478.0,False,[],,13586.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Message,13240,1639836943,2022-10-25T08:39:19+00:00,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"❓ Will a dirty bomb be used on Ukraine? 

➖ Last few days saw increased talks about potential use of a dirty bomb in Ukraine. Russian Minister of Defense Sergey Shoigu has called several of his peers warning about the possible outcome. Russian Armed Forces are training to operate in the environment of increased radiation. How real is the threat? Who would be responsible for it? 

➖ The threat of “dirty bomb”, i. e. a non-nuclear bomb filled with radioactive materials that is capable of radioactive contamination of quite large area has always been looming around ever since the beginning of the Ukrainian conflict. While the government of Ukraine does not possess the technologies, qualification and facilities to produce real nuclear weapons, Ukraine has a number of nuclear power plants inherited from the USSR as well as access to Chernobyl “burial site” that also has a lot of radioactive materials. 

➖ It means that Ukraine is technologically capable to use a dirty bomb. Capabilities of Russia are not even questioned although Russia has no reasons to use dirty bombs as it has a plenty of tactical nuclear weapons that can do immense real damage and decide the conflict if used. 

❓Who would be responsible for it? Well, we have to see, which side will gain profit and advantage of such a provocation. We can surely be confident of one thing, no matter what happens, Ukraine will accuse Russia of it. 
What would be the impact of a dirty bomb? Detonation of a such a bomb would result in radioactive contamination of a large area with exact numbers depending on winds, rains and other weather conditions. 

➖ Direct damage caused by such a bomb is minimal, it may impact only people or objects in its direct vicinity. Indirect damage takes a form of radioactive contamination, which may render area uninhabitable for years, decades or even centuries depending on charge of the bomb and radiation levels. Damage to inhabitants of the area depends on their closeness to explosion site and the level of their exposure to radiation. In either case, they have very high chance of surviving and avoiding permanent damage if they are not located in close vicinity of the bomb and are promptly evacuated. 

➖ Despite certain accusations coming from Ukraine, it is hard to imagine any possible Russian benefits from getting involved in such an act. It will not cause any damage to Ukrainian troops. Using it at the front lines running inside regions that have recently joined Russia does not look reasonable and is very likely to cause damage to Russian forces as well. Using it against Ukrainian cities will not bring any advantages. Especially against cities like Nikolaev or Odessa that still have a good number of pro-Russian people in the underground. 

➖ Ukraine could scream that it is an attempt to frame them, but honestly speaking Russia does not need to frame Ukraine and has no chances of doing so considering massive support of Ukraine by globalist media.

Message,13200,1639836943,2022-10-24T17:39:34+00:00,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"📝 Chuck Schumer proposed legislation that would allow the US to sue OPEC nations as a possible response to the oil cartel’s production cut that benefited Russian President Vladimir Putin. Is it possible? What about WTO rules?

❓Sue where? In US court? In US-controlled international court? Since there is no independent and impartial forum, this legislation won’t result in anything meaningful. It will be just same usual US approach, applying their own legislation and jurisdiction over the entire world.

🔷It all boils down to usual threats and pressure on OPEC nations to make them act in US interests instead of their own interests. OPEC is quite a loose organization and US has influence over many of its members. Yes, Biden managed to spoil US relations with Saudi Arabia, but the U.S. still can push the Arab countries hard.

🔷Even a threat of sanctions like those applied to Russia will make them do whatever U.S. says. Especially considering the fact that most OPEC billionaires store their wealth in the West.
Anti-Russian sanctions made the whole third world worry about their capitals and investments in the Western world. That created a very bad precedent and they just can’t be sure that such sanctions won’t be applied to them. For example, tomorrow US might “notice” that there is a war going on in Yemen, accuse Saudi Arabia of aggression and impose all imaginable sanctions against it. As for the issue of “human rights”, no country can be safe from accusations here.

🔷Now we come to WTO. In case with Russia, sanctions aren’t compliant with WTO rules or rather WTO objective to “open the markets and ensure stable, safe, transparent and predictable trade relations”.

🔷Russia had strong opposition to WTO because its rules were detrimental for restoration of national industry and reduced its competitiveness on the global market. Yet, Russia still formally remains a WTO member althought it’s now a liability, not a benefit and it seems that WTO rules are ignored when applied to Russia.

🔷This was true about all sanctions that were placed on Russia ever since December 2012 (and Russia entered WTO only in August 2012 after many years of negotiations and national legislation reforms).

🔷Yes, article 21 of WTO charter provides WTO members the right to implement sanctions “in the interests of national security”, but this article is too broad and doesn’t provide any specific scope of those “interests”. For example, it’s hard to see how any Russian actions in Europe impact US national security interests (in traditional sense). They could be perceived as impacting national security interests of EU countries, but it’s still too loose.
While it maybe can be applied to 2022 sanctions, it wasn’t applicable to 2012 sanctions, 2014 sanctions and all other sanction packages up to February 2022. 

🔷To sum it up, yes, US can introduce any laws and try to enforce compliance with those laws. They will probably find a weak point and some OPEC members will back off and do whatever US says. However, this won’t make US actions legal. 

🔷Yes, there are antitrust rules and laws, but they can be applied only in relevant jurisdictions. Laws of the United States have no jurisdiction over the entire world and the very idea of price control by the buyer is alien to the concept of free market.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2767.0,12.0,2022-10-24T17:43:06+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,223.0,MessageEntityItalic,2575.0,10.0,MessageEntityItalic,2678.0,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,372.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,372.0,,,,,MessageReplies,3.0,25478.0,False,[],,13249.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Message,13004,1639836943,2022-10-22T14:20:44+00:00,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"🤔 Why did the West turn its back on Putin when he (following 9/11) stretched out a hand and suggested that we cooperate in combating terrorism and even suggested that both Russia and the West might benefit from Russia joining NATO?

Because Putin’s advances were not like he begged to take Russia in. He offered partnership. From Western point of view I see a number of possible problems:

1️⃣Firstly, Putin wanted Russia to play a role that would fit Russia as the largest country in the world with second strong military without consideration of Russian economy as evaluated by the West. Not just another NATO member, but an equal to the U.S.
The U.S. naturally did not want to concede any of its powers and did not want a potential challenger in its own military block.

2️⃣Secondly, terrorism was too small and insignificant target for the scale of NATO. Fighting terrorism is a task for Interpol. Using violent tactics to prevent terrorist attacks just creates more sources of terrorism. ISIS emerged as a natural consequences of invasion of Iraq.

NATO clearly understood it, so they needed an enemy to justify their existence. If an alliance does not have enemies, people may question its usefulness. Fortunately for the West, newly added NATO members from the Eastern Europe gave them an enemy.

Most post-communist states that entered NATO were ruled by nationalistic anti-communist elites and their agenda was heavily based on the idea of “Soviet occupation”. They saw (and see) Russia responsible for whatever USSR did, so anti-Russian sentiments became a noticeable part of their national ideologies.

I don’t know if they were serious when they were saying they are afraid of Russian invasion (they say it even now, but they also said it back in 1990s when Russia was in shambles).

Choosing Russia as the main enemy was reasonable because of numerous factors. First of all, this would solidify NATO membership of Eastern European countries. They wouldn’t challenge the U.S. and object against adding Russia to NATO if the U.S. chose this course. However, this would greatly reduce their enthusiasm about NATO and they would see no sense in staying.

Anyway, China was not yet a challenger to U.S. but still was economically stronger than Russia, so the U.S. saw it best to increase pressure on Russia, deprive Russia of all influence in neighboring countries and prevent all chances of Russian economical restoration back to USSR level and beyond it.

3️⃣Thirdly, there were technical difficulties. Reforming Russian army to NATO standards and NATO equipment would essentially be equivalent to reforming U.S. army to Soviet standards. A massive and pointless project. This means that NATO would have to adapt its standards for Russian arms and military specifics. As the result U.S. defense industry would see emerging competitor within their own military bloc, and that was unacceptable for the U.S.

4️⃣Fourthly, NATO with Russia would not have any challengers and this would make its existence pointless.

So, we see that NATO membership for Russia was indeed impossible. What about partnership? Yes, partnership was possible and it existed. Many of the above-listed factors played against this partnership but it was Russian desire to have sovereign policies that made the split inevitable.

Continued and increasing pressure of the United States of America on post-Soviet countries through a web of NGOs and US-trained politicians created numerous problems in countries bordering Russia and Russia could not ignore those problems.
These hostile actions were the core reason for alienation between Russia and NATO and nullified all chances to expand partnership.

With time Russian rhetorics changed, just as rhetorics of NATO and the United States. Last year Russian President finally decided to raise an issue that was bothering all Russian people for over 20 years - the issue of NATO expansion to Russian borders.

Russia did send an ultimatum to NATO. It was rejected. Masks went off. Dismissal of the ultimatum opened the way for a new Cold War or even a hot one.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,8434.0,75.0,2022-10-22T14:28:06+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,231.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,366.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,366.0,,,,,MessageReplies,9.0,25478.0,False,[],,13104.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I trust on the ground journalism ONLY from truly independent and reputable - ie proven integrity, journalists. I always have multiple sources, and a range of expertise that I can weigh 'facts' by. 

The point is, that these reliable sources if they are not echoing the fakes and war propaganda in favour of Ukraine are 'cancelled' in the West, and i increasingly smeared and  persecuted in mind  boogling ways. Like UK journalist Graham Philips and German journalist Alina Lipp. Who were charged without trail and had their bank accounts frozen.  Outstanding journalists of impeccable integrity  like Canadian Eva Bartlett have been placed on kill lists, and smeared. Even John Pilger has been cancelled.

The Western social and MSM media are thoroughly inflitrated and RUN by US/UK security and intelligence services. Twitter, the Guardian, the New York Times... Reuters and national media throughout Europe. Take time to research this.  Of course Facebook instagram etc
  Any truly independent media is aggressively deplatformed. Not just Russian media.

I also suggest actually viewing some Russian sources. In my experience there seems to be a lot of criticism and debate going on in Russia. For instance I am actually shocked at the quality, the standard is high. Especially if you compare that to the mindless rhetoric and one liners posing as political discourse in Western countries.

— It is not a simple question. First of all, not all independent media in Russia are banned. Not all of them violate Russian laws that restrict attempts to discredit the special operation in Ukraine, the Russian government and the Russian Armed Forces. 

❔However, should one trust mainstream Western media over Russian media? It is a big question. The problem with mainstream Western media is that they strongly stand on Ukrainian side and promote solely Ukrainian version of events. They cheer and exaggerate even the smallest Ukrainian successes and ignore even the most obvious facts that confirm Russian point of view. 

The industry of fakes is another noticeable difference. Ukrainian president has a background in TV show industry and he probably brought a good part of his former team to work on filming shows and videos that would bring him the greatest support of the West. All these fakes are well known and debunked by the Russian side with factual proof. However, the Western media did not debunk those fakes and their audience still believes it was real. 

It is impossible to trust sources that completely distort facts. Russian media outlets don’t present critical opinions about the special operation in Ukraine, but at least they don’t distort reality. 

Let’s give an example: 

Western media says: Russia is losing war, hundreds of thousands Russian soldiers are dead, Russian tanks are all broken and abandoned, Putin’s regime is crumbling, Russia is bringing untrained conscripts with WW1 rifles to the fronts as cannon fodder;

Russian media says: Russian army has completed tactical retreat from Kharkov region and fell back to prepared defense positions in Kherson region, at the same time it is slowly advancing in Artemovsk, the number of permanent casualties is 5.937, Ukraine depends on Western supplies of arms, Zelensky’s regime stubbornly refuses negotiations

Note that the West is operating vague and overly exaggerated statements, while Russia is providing specific numbers and facts that are logically reasonable and can be verified.

⏺Western media says: Putin threatens the world with nuclear weapons

⏺Russian media says: Putin welcomed new territories into Russia and confirmed willingness to defend them at all costs.

Since transcripts of Putin’s speech are available, it’s easy to look what he said and who is lying.

Russia does not try to create a fake picture of victories, it prefers real thing to virtual victories. Of course, not everything is so simply and not all Western media are completely biased. However, even media of neutral countries don’t see the Ukrainian conflict properly because they view not as an invasion and not as liberation but as a proxy war between Russia and the West.

As for banning “independent media”, there is one factor to consider. Moral condemnation is good and all, but if your country is fighting, you have to support it, not condemn it. Anything else is just treason. It could be disguised under moral values but it’s still treason. 

Right or wrong, doesn’t matter. Time for judgment and evaluation will come later, time to punish may come later. Calling for peace is great, calling for surrender and defeat of your country is betrayal. Of course, some may not see the difference.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,10499.0,54.0,2022-10-20T15:09:00+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,86.0,MessageEntityBold,341.0,1.0,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,341.0,1.0,MessageEntityBold,342.0,71.0,MessageEntityItalic,712.0,55.0,MessageEntityBold,1360.0,25.0,MessageEntityUnderline,1360.0,25.0,MessageEntityBold,2158.0,1.0,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,2158.0,1.0,MessageEntityBold,2159.0,20.0,MessageEntityBold,2227.0,1.0,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,2227.0,1.0,MessageEntityBold,2228.0,20.0,MessageEntityBold,3137.0,81.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,359.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,359.0,,,,,MessageReplies,29.0,25478.0,False,[],,14850.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Putin is the blocker to the NWO, the cabal who wants us to ""own nothing and you will be happy"" eating your bugs and afraid of their Climate Crisis scam.  Putin isn't having a bar of that ... plus Russia has more resources than anyone, even the US.
LOL, the sanctions backfired, as anyone who really knew anything about Russia would have known.  Now Europe, stalwarts of NATO, is in deep shit.

Unfortunately, it seems that warnings are not enough to end this conflict and bring Ukraine to negotiations table.

It looks like Putin has to choose between extending this conflict for years that will slowly drain Russian power and resources at no cost to Russian real enemies in the West and launching a decisive strike that will completely cripple Ukrainian infrastructure and inevitably result in humanitarian disaster.

Ukraine is not a part of Russia.
If you are talking about secession of Ukraine from USSR, this act is legitimate only because it was acknowledged by the parties involved, just as the entire process of USSR dissolution.

Ukraine had the right to secede from USSR, but this secession had to be preceded by years of negotiations. Every single possible issue should have been foreseen and addressed in the final agreement. 

Brexit took many years and EU integration is nowhere close to USSR level. Sole transition period should not be less than ten years, or even more, with Russia and Ukraine still being parts of the same state, the USSR. 

Every border of every single region should be fixed and set in stone with consideration of all historical aspects and will of local people. All territories given to Ukraine after its entry to USSR would have to be subject to negotiation.

Ukrainian advance in all regions has stopped. In the south of the country, Ukrainian forces are preparing for further offensive deep in the region. Russian artillery and warplanes are heavily attacking the amassing forces of the enemy.

Blaming Russia, the Kiev regime called on NATO to launch 'preventive' strikes against Russia, and not 'wait for Russia’s nuclear strikes'.

'What should NATO do? Exclude the possibility of Russia using nuclear weapons…. Preemptive strikes so that they know what will happen to them if they do use. That’s what NATO should do: review the order of use', said Zelensky.

Moscow assesses his demands as call for the outbreak of World War. The West is inflaming a nuclear war, and the puppet instable Zelensky has turned into a monster whose hands can destroy the planet, the Russian Foreign ministry responded. Watch the video by @southfronteng to learn more.

We recorded our congratulations to the Russian President in the hero-city of Smolensk, a historical place where Russian civilization and the formation of the sovereignty of our state began. Here more than four centuries ago Russia repelled the onslaught of foreign invaders who claimed our statehood. 

It is the President's firm, often difficult, but necessary decisions that help us in the current situation not to lose heart and continue to fight bravely for the preservation of Russia's independence. We have chosen key statements that emphasize the importance of what Vladimir Vladimirovich is doing for our country at the moment, and showed them to the public. 

The location was not chosen by chance: the Fortress Wall protected our state from Western invaders long before the advent of NATO. Therefore, in this sacred place on the Embankment of Knyaz Vladimir, the collector of the Russian land, we held our performance that night, showing quotes of our national leader with the help of several projectors.

Russia is not fighting any energy war to win it or lose it. Russia is a large global supplier of energy and fuel.

High oil prices are beneficial for Russia and Saudi Arabia, two biggest oil producers. At the present state of global economy oil prices are not that relevant for Russia because Russia has little means to use extra oil profits without proper economical reforms and expansion of foreign trade. In fact, with reduced import volumes and unacceptable risks of foreign investments Russian state has little incentives to increase export.

— Well, in this case the United States will face the same problem that Putin has right now. What if he doesn’t give in to the threat? Should they fulfill their promise and destroy the world? This is the problem of mutual guaranteed destruction. If nuclear war does happen, it won’t have any winners. 

Besides, Putin has already responded to such threat. I can remind you his words: “We will go to heavens as martyrs and they will just die”. 

By the way, Putin is capable of civil talks. Russia is capable of civil talks and negotiations. 

The problem is that negotiatons require concessions from both sides. What the West is doing is called “ultimatums”. They are not offering any deals that could be acceptable to Russia and Putin. They are just making demands. It can’t be called “talks”. 

The other problem is that the West doesn’t officially participate in this conflict. This gives them an obvious option to cheat and break their promises. For example, if they promise ceasefire but Ukraine continues military activities, they will just say: “Well, Ukraine is a free country, we can’t control them”. 

On the other hand, any negotiations between Russia and Ukraine are not possible while the West is strongly supporting Ukrainian war effort. This gives Ukraine false hopes of victory and forces Russia to raise stakes. If the West took the role of mediator instead of choosing a side, this would have been over in April. 

Russian and Ukrainian sides were ready for compromise back then, in fact Russian people would support the proposed deal about “freezing” the issue of Crimea and Donbass for a period of 20–30 years. All Russian demands have also been more or less addressed. It would be a real compromise and it would bring Ukraine much better results than it may get now, when new territories became a part of the Russian Federation and Russia has new “start position” for talks. 

Putin has openly called Ukraine and the West to resume negotiations and end the conflict. We can’t say what compromise will he agree on, his options are getting more limited with time as Russia commits more and more to this conflict. 

However, I still think that he could agree on “freezing” the issue of recognition. He could agree on Ukraine being guaranteed by Western countries (and Russia) with their automatic involvement in case of any future conflict. 

That’s not NATO membership but the same benefits in terms of defense (just without NATO bases in the country that could threaten Russia). 

The tasks of demilitarization and denazification are partially fulfilled, I guess Putin can agree on some moderate solutions there, like laws prohibiting language-based discrimination. Maybe Putin could even agree on some financial compensation in form of humanitarian aid or favorable gas transit contracts (but not in form of compensation, this would cause him lose face). 

Maybe there still is a chance to end it peacefully and make the first step in a long road to reconciliation. Maybe there is no need to make this an existential issue and endanger the entire humankind. Turning our planet into a radioactive wasteland won’t solve the problem.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2666.0,4.0,2022-10-05T10:27:13+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,199.0,MessageEntityBold,582.0,61.0,MessageEntityUnderline,811.0,47.0,MessageEntityBold,1149.0,159.0,MessageEntityBold,1769.0,60.0,MessageEntityItalic,2700.0,72.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,307.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,307.0,,,,,MessageReplies,7.0,25478.0,False,[],,9341.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am most annoyed and somewhat alarmed by the West’s blind support for a corrupt, kleptocrat fascist regime in Kyiv and the hysterical Russophobia. And the public’s willingness to overlook Kyiv’s many documented flaws. They are being primed to be fascism apologists, without even knowing it.

I don’t support the invasion of Ukraine nor the annexation but do recognize that Ukraine has a neo-Nazi problem that targets ethnic Russians, & more broadly anyone who isn’t an ethnic Ukrainian and that the people in Crimea and Donbass have legitimate reasons not to want to be ruled by Kyiv. Partition is the inevitable solution. Berlin and Paris failed to keep the peace through diplomacy. The jury is still out on why.

As for Macron. French public opinion is very sceptical of Kyiv. The French aren’t knee jerk Russophobes, either. The last time France went to war against Russia was back in Napoleon times and the two countries have mostly been allies since.

I don’t like Macron and I think he’s pretty useless as a diplomat. But his relatively cautious and neutral position on the war in Ukraine reflects French public opinion. If anything, he is more pro-Kyiv than the general public. Any of his pro-Kyiv tweets in French are quickly swamped with criticism of supporting the “clown” in Kyiv, aka Zelensky.

French news media echoes the public’s low opinion of Zelensky.

It’s not about believing. And it’s not about Russians but about their leaders. Words are just words. Empty words.

Geopolitics looks at potentials.

The examples of people like Saddam and the last Lybian leader shows that the West cannot be trusted. The West is not monolithic, but their groups of power support each other when the decision is made. Sure, not everyone in US elites was fond about invasion of Iraq, all decision-makers perfectly knew that chemical weapons are a fake, some may have opposed it, but when the decision was made, the entire Western block joyously approved this.

The Western block has clear goal - to preserve their economical and military superiority and to keep status quo by thriving over the rest of the world. Leader of the Western block, the United States of America has additional goal to prevent other countries and entities in this block from getting too powerful and challenging their status as ultimate decision maker.

The Western block has clear enemies - all countries that can challenge their superiority in any aspects. This is especially true about economical superiority.

Russian attempt to create a Eurasian Union could create such a challenger. With Ukraine this Union would be a viable entity with over 250 million consumers. In a few decades it could emerge as a competing economical power. In addition to military potential of Russia, this would create unacceptable challenge. That is the ultimate reason for Western interference in Ukraine in 2014 and one of the roots of current events.

The West doesn’t want to destroy Russia. It wants Russia weak and controllable. It wants Russia as a “global gas station” with most profits ultimately going to Wall Street pockets.

Russia is not the only entity weakened by this crisis. It also hurts Europe. Cooperation between Russia and Europe, especially between Russia and Germany could change the situation with the entire Europe virtually being economical and political vassal of the United States.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,3348.0,14.0,2022-09-27T16:12:46+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,68.0,MessageEntityBold,183.0,34.0,MessageEntityBold,1611.0,182.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,275.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,275.0,,,,,MessageReplies,9.0,25478.0,False,[],,9285.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Was der Diktator und Tyrann Gaddafi seinem Volk alles antat, wird jetzt täglich Stück für Stück bekannt. Hier eine Aufzählung seiner Grausamkeiten unter denen die Libyer 4 Jahrzehnte leiden mussten. 1. Es gab keine Stromrechnung in Libyen. Strom war kostenlos für alle Bürger. 2. Es gab keine Zinsen auf Kredite. Die staatlichen Banken vergaben Darlehen an alle Bürger zu null Prozent Zinsen per Gesetz. 3. Ein HeimZuhause zu haben galt als ein Menschenrecht in Libyen. 4. Alle Frischvermählten in Libyen erhielten 50.000 US-Dollar. Dieses Geld sollte den Menschen ermöglichen ihre erste Wohnung zu kaufen. Die Regierung wollte so zum Start einer Familie beitragen. 5. Bildung und medizinische Behandlungen waren frei in Libyen. Bevor Gaddafi an die Macht kam konnten nur 25 Prozent der Libyer lesen. Heute liegt die Zahl bei 83 Prozent. 6. Wollten Libyer in der Landwirtschaft Karriere machen, erhielten sie Ackerland, eine Bauernhaus, Geräte, Saatgut und Vieh als Schnellstart für ihre Farmen und das alles kostenlos. 7. Wenn Libyer keine Ausbildung oder medizinische Einrichtungen finden konnten die sie benötigten, hatten sie die Möglichkeit mit der Hilfe staatliche Gelder ins Ausland zu gehen. Sie bekamen 2.300 USD im Monat für Unterkunft und Auto gezahlt. 8. Wenn ein Libyer ein Auto kaufte, subventionierte die Regierung 50 Prozent des Preises. 9. Der Preis für Benzin in Libyen war 0,14 $ (12 Rappen oder ca. 0,10 Euro) pro Liter. 10. Wenn ein Libyer keine Arbeit bekam nach dem Studium, zahlte der Staat das durchschnittliche Gehalt des Berufs in dem er eine Arbeit suchte, bis eine fachlich adäquate Beschäftigung gefunden wurde.. 11. Libyen hat keine Auslandsschulden und ihre Reserven in Höhe von 150.000.000.000 $ sind jetzt weltweit eingefroren und wohl für immer verloren. 12. Ein Teil jeden libyschen Öl-Verkaufs wurde direkt auf die Konten aller libyschen Bürger gutgeschrieben. 13. Mütter die ein Kind gebaren erhielten 5.000 US-Dollar. 14. 25 Prozent der Libyer haben einen Hochschulabschluss. 15. Gaddafi startete Das Great-Man-Made-River-Projekt (GMMRP oder GMMR, dt. Großer menschengemachter Fluss-Projekt) in Libyen Es ist das weltweit größte Trinkwasser-Pipeline-Projekt für eine bessere Wasserversorgung von Bevölkerung und Landwirtschaft. Gott sei Dank haben Nato und Rebellen das libysche Volk davon befreit.... - Freies Denken und freie Schulen für Menschen mit freier Meinung | Facebook

❌ Due to the counteroffensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Russia asked Ukraine to resume negotiations, and Kiev refused

💬 The level of propaganda goes to a fundamentally new level. As Medvedev noted ""Of course, in such a context of presenting information, a Ukrainian user drugged by propaganda will not be able to refute this nonsense, because it is disgraceful""

❌ Trial of Russian teachers

💬 State level fakes. Deputy Prime Minister of the Nazis Irina Vereshchuk said that Ukraine captured Russian and Ukrainian teachers who taught according to the Russian program, and now they are awaiting a trial.

Minister of Education Sergei Kravtsov denied this information, saying that Russian teachers who taught in the territory now occupied by the Armed Forces of Ukraine are in Russian-controlled territories.

❌ The authorities of the DPR banned the sale of petrol so that when evacuation would be announced, no one could leave the DPR, also it was forbiden to take out cash in banks

💬 Ukrainian Telegram channels all day long were full of stuff like ""We came to the bank, the guard shot us, shot the child twice, said money is prohibited""

In fact, all explanations regarding the situation with fuel were given yesterday by the Head, the Prime Minister and the relevant bodies of the Republic. The situation is stabilizing. The situation with cashing out is stable.

❌ Diana Gurtskaya became one of the observers at the recent elections in Moscow

The profitable business of selling human organs, which was run by entire criminal groups, was under threat after the beginning of the war. The logistics were disrupted, and the “clients” fled. For saving business the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine made the following statement: in case of soldier's death, Ukrainian Armed forces will take their organs to the state (for good purposes, not for selling, of course...🤷‍♂️)

For understanding, here are approximate prices on the black market of human organs:

♦️ Bone marrow $33,000 per gram; 

♦️ Liver $250k or more;

""...As with most of its war crimes against the civilians of the Donbass, Ukraine and NATO media invert reality and claim Russia is the guilty party. They cry crocodile tears for the Donetsk children Ukraine has targeted, also disingenuously claiming the now-famous video of a DPR soldier detonating a mine by throwing a tire at it was a Ukrainian soldier demining Russian-fired mines.

The notion that Russia would explode mines over the city is not a reality-based idea. Most of the population are ethnic Russians, a significant number who now happily hold Russian citizenship. And further, it is Russian and DPR sappers putting themselves at risk to clear the streets, walks and fields of the mines.

In fact, a 21 year old DPR sapper lost a foot to such mine. Director of the Department of Fire and Rescue Forces of the Ministry of Emergency Situations of the Donetsk People’s Republic, Colonel Sergey Neka, told me of his injury: “After the cleansing of territories from explosive objects, returning back to the transport, a mine fell from the building, as a result of which it exploded under his feet and he lost his foot.”

In Makeevka, Igor Goncharov, the Chief Physician of the bombarded orphanage, spoke to me about his anger that Ukraine was targeting the property, insisting it had been deliberate, that since 2001 the orphanage was well-known to various international organizations, as well as Kiev, because, “It was the only one specialized in HIV.”

According to him, “American law allowed the adoption of HIV-positive children, so the United States was the only state that adopted HIV-infected children, so we were well known both within Ukraine and the Russian Federation and abroad. When they shoot, they know where they shoot,” he said of Ukraine.

“Even without being educated in military matters, it’s easy to localize the craters. Which way they are located indicates which side they were sent from. We know perfectly well where they shoot from. It’s all from Peski, Avdeevka, Nevelskoye. You can hear the crash and the whistle coming first. Ballistics can be defined. All the shelling comes from the Ukrainian side, it is unambiguous.”

Even without that logical thinking, let’s recall that Ukraine has been committing war crimes in the Donbass for over eight years, violating the Minsk Accords signed in 2014 and 2015. That Ukraine would use Petal mines from its enormous stockpile, after already shelling and sniping civilians, it not at all out of the question.

Ukrainian nationalists openly declare they view Russians as sub-human. School books teach this warped ideology. Videos show the extent of this mentality: teaching children not only to also hate Russians and see them as not humans, but also brainwashing them to believe killing Donbass residents is acceptable. The Ukrainian government itself funds Neo-Nazi-run indoctrination camps for youths.

As mentioned at the start, Ukraine signed the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention, under which Ukraine was obliged to destroy its 6 million stock of the mines. However, reportedly, its stockpile remains over 3.3 million such mines.

The convention, “prohibits the use, stockpiling, production, and transfer of anti-personnel landmines (APLs).” Further, as outlined, Ukraine is, “in violation of Article 5 of the Mine Ban Treaty due to missing its 1 June 2016 clearance deadline without having requested and being granted an extension.

Ukraine’s firing of rockets containing these mines is against international law and the Geneva Conventions. Ukraine is specifically targeting civilian areas with them. It is pure terrorism. And it is another Ukrainian war crime in a very long list of war crimes stretching back over eight years.”",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,5003.0,15.0,,Eva,,[],,MessageMediaWebPage,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityTextUrl,19.0,20.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,8259.0,,,,,,,,MessageReplies,0.0,25478.0,False,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WebPage,9.170793121632556e+18,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1381044150.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wie das? Russland hält trotz Sanktionen durch - das französische Fernsehen zeigte eine Geschichte aus Moskau.

""Wirtschaftssanktionen wurden wiederholt gegen Russland verhängt. Viele große Unternehmen verließen das Land. Für Moskau blieb dies jedoch ohne Folgen, es hält sich weiterhin aufrecht.

In Moskau in einen Supermarkt zu gehen, ist wie in jedem anderen westlichen Geschäft. Die Regale sind gut gefüllt. Kunden können leicht französische Produkte oder Weinflaschen aus Europa finden. Der Mangel, den einige Russen vor einigen Monaten befürchteten, ist nicht eingetreten.

""Es gibt Gegenstände, die verschwunden sind, aber sie wurden ersetzt"", sagte einer der Russen. „Ich werde Sie nicht anlügen, es ist alles da“, bestätigt ein anderer.

Unternehmen umgehen Sanktionen.
Die russische Wirtschaft leistet Widerstand. Der Rückgang des BIP in diesem Jahr wird 4 % betragen, was weit von den erwarteten minus 12 % entfernt ist.

Russische Unternehmen schaffen es tatsächlich, die Beschränkungen zu umgehen. Ein Mechaniker kauft zum Beispiel chinesische Teile statt der üblichen französischen.""

“If the UAF attacks continue, it (nuclear catastrophe) can happen at any moment.

🔵 On 5-6 August the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) once again attacked ZNPP by shelling the critically important infrastructural objects of the plant as well as its satellite city Energodar. Twenty shells have been fired during the strikes

🔵 On 5 August, at 14:45, the Ukrainian shelling (three shells hit in the proximity of the training centre next to the territory of the open switchgear of the NPP) resulted in shutdown of the autotransformer and the high voltage line providing backup power to the Units №1 and №2 of ZNPP

🔵 On 5 August, at 16:45, the Ukrainian side committed an artillery shelling (four shells) of oil and fuel oil handling equipment and the site of hydrogen receivers. Damage of the pipeline caused jet fire that was localized due to timely and professional actions of ZNPP personnel and Russian military

🔵 On 6 August, at 19:42, the AFU units attacked ZNPP once again. Three artillery shells of 155 millimeters caliber (NATO standard) exploded next to the spent fuel storage and only 200 meters from the operating unit. One person was injured

🔵 On 7 August ZNPP was again shelled by the Ukrainian armed formations. The high-voltage power line “Kakhovskaya” was damaged. Equipment of an open switchgear (750 kW) was damaged as a result of a power surge. At Unit №4, that was operational at 10% capacity, the power supply of control and safety system went offline. This triggered the emergency protection of the Unit №4

🔵 The Ukrainian personnel of the plant has decided on cooldown of the Unit №4 of ZNPP, as well as downpower of the Units №5 and №6. Currently, the Units №5 and №6 are downpowered to 500 MW

🔵 On 11 August Ukrainian armed formations again tried to attack the ZNPP with missiles and UAVs. This attack was repulsed by the air defense forces

🔵 In addition to direct military threats to the security of ZNPP the Kiev regime is working on other scenarios to create intentional preconditions for a nuclear accident at ZNPP. Inter alia, Kiev is considering different options of cutting the plant off from the Ukrainian power grid and keeps increasing psychological pressure on ZNPP employees and their relatives (they regularly receive phone calls threatening them with criminal prosecutions and physical reprisals)

🔵 Attacks of the Kiev regime on ZNPP endanger the safety and security of Europe and the whole world. In case of an accident at this station the radiation contamination zone (more than 5300 square kilometers, length around 420 km) would cover the population of Kievskaya, Zaporozhskaya, Kharkovskaya, Poltavskaya, Khersonskaya, Odesskaya, Nikolaevskaya, Kirovogradskaya, Vinnitskaya oblasts, Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics, border areas of Russia and Belarus, as well as Moldova, Bulgaria and Romania. The situation could get worse because of adverse weather conditions and spread of possible contamination zone to South-Ukrainian NPP and the nuclear fuel storage at Chernobyl NPP, as well as water arteries. The Black Sea and the Bosphorus Strait would become unsuitable for navigation for a long time. The shores of Abkhazia, Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania and Türkiye would be contaminated with high levels of radiation

❗️The UN, the IAEA, as well as all countries that have influence on the Kiev regime should do everything possible to ensure immediate cessation of Ukrainian attacks on ZNPP before they resulted in devastating consequences for the whole mankind",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,39916.0,260.0,,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,91.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,1308.0,,,,,,,,MessageReplies,0.0,25478.0,False,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1592391298.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""In the Voznesensk area of the Nikolaev region an arsenal that stored 45,000 tons of ammunition recently supplied to the Ukrainian Armed Forces by NATO countries has been destroyed,” the ministry stated, adding that Russian forces eliminated five other ammo depots.

Meanwhile, the Russian army conducted strikes on the deployment point of units of Ukraine's 72nd mechanized brigade at an agricultural facility in the Donetsk People’s Republic city of Artemovsk, wiping out up to 130 soldiers and eight transport and armored vehicles, the ministry’s statement read.

Ukraine will conduct a successful counterattack and recapture Kherson. Ukrainian officials, from President Volodymyr Zelensky to Ukrainian military experts, have repeatedly stated this. Foreign media also wrote about the coming offensive.

The fact:
Such statements have been made since early July, but there are still no signs of a counteroffensive. At the beginning of August, Ukraine announced that there would not be one this year. And as for today, Mykhailo Podolyak, advisor to the head of Zelensky's office, called reports of an imminent attack by the Ukrainian Armed Forces on Kherson ""part of an information and psychological operation"". 

""Certainly, all public comments today are part of the information and psychological operations We need to demoralize the Russian army <...> we have a completely different war, a 'creative war', and our partners can see that,"" Podolyak said in an interview with the BBC.

We wrote back in mid-July that Kiev would not be able to organize an effective counteroffensive. Ukraine does not have the people, equipment, or other resources to do this. Ukrainian and foreign sources, among others, have drawn attention to this fact. 

In fact, most of Ukraine's virtual victories are a psychological operation, which was covered as much as possible in the media. The Ukrainian Armed Forces shelled the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, blaming the Russian military with absolutely no evidence, showered Donetsk with anti-personnel mines, hit the Antonov bridge over the Dnieper, trying unsuccessfully to prove that this would create serious difficulties for the Russian Armed Forces. The main purpose of these attacks is to manipulate the consciousness of TV viewers and readers of the Ukrainian and Western press into believing that the AFU is ""indomitable power,"" which in fact it is not.

Since the end of July, the Telegram channels reported, citing a source in the office of the president of Ukraine, that the virtual battle for Kherson was being used to ""change public opinion in the West and create new momentum for international support for Ukraine,"" that is, to get another sum for ""rebuilding the country"" and another batch of Western weapons, which are actively flowing into the ""black market.""",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,6952.0,14.0,,,,[],,MessageMediaWebPage,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,11.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,195.0,1.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,216.0,5.0,MessageEntityBold,251.0,10.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,292.0,16.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,398.0,9.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,526.0,6.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,934.0,5.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,1104.0,9.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,1118.0,7.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,1341.0,7.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,1445.0,8.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,1489.0,3.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,1888.0,8.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,2224.0,7.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,646.0,,,,,,,,MessageReplies,0.0,25478.0,False,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WebPage,5.081221150910058e+18,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1799870292.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The provocations of the Ukrainian side in Zaporozhye to undermine the nuclear power plant can cause a global catastrophe. This was stated by US military analyst Scott Ritter.

""In this case, it's not just the physical terrain of Ukraine and the area of the nuclear power plant would be affected - we are talking about the contamination of the Black Sea, which will then drift on to the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles and beyond.

The latest report released by a world famous human rights group Amnesty International says the Armed Forces of Ukraine put civilians in danger. They establish military bases in residential areas, often in schools or hospitals, which is a severe law violation.

Russia has not eliminated any American HIMARS in Ukraine, according to Reuters, quoting the Pentagon spokesman.

The fact:
The Pentagon provides no evidence for its claim, and Kiev and Washington keep confusing statements regarding the weapons being supplied to Ukraine. First, the Pentagon reports that it has no means to trace the fate of weapons being sent to Ukraine. And then a representative of the Chief Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine, Vadym Skibitsky, states in an interview with the Telegraph that strikes using US multiple-launch rocket systems (HIMARS) are carried out after consultation with American side, hence the US authorities are well aware of the location of the heavy weapons. Moreover, Western journalists even film the numerous news reports footage about HIMARS. It is therefore hard to believe another statement by the Pentagon, as it has compromised its credibility through repeated lies. 

Sixteen of the declared 20 HIMARS were delivered to Ukraine. Recently, the Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu reported that six launchers and over 200 HIMARS missiles had been destroyed.

Indirectly, the fact that the Ukrainian military has reduced the number of HIMARS is indicated by a reduction in the number of news reports on their use in shelling. While at the end of June they appeared on the agenda almost daily, now reports on their use are related only to strategically important targets - such as the strike on the detention facility in Yelenivka.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,2589.0,4.0,,,1.3276745489241844e+16,[],,MessageMediaPhoto,5.426903152768172e+18,5.386594785659256e+17,"[2, 97, 189, 237, 15, 0, 0, 19, 253, 99, 245, 147, 138, 33, 64, 228, 75, 242, 172, 101, 158, 107, 161, 121, 143, 135, 86, 189, 50]",2.0,False,[],,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,11.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,82.0,7.0,MessageEntityBold,124.0,10.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,302.0,7.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,506.0,6.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,778.0,4.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,1075.0,8.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,1349.0,8.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,589.0,,,,,,,,MessageReplies,0.0,25478.0,False,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1799870292.0,i,"[1, 39, 40, 216, 35, 158, 255, 0, 157, 33, 96, 27, 4, 211, 170, 54, 64, 204, 78, 72, 252, 40, 1, 119, 175, 169, 253, 105, 67, 41, 56, 4, 209, 229, 167, 247, 69, 40, 0, 112, 40, 1, 113, 69, 20, 80, 5, 121, 8, 102, 112, 15, 35, 131, 249, 86, 18, 171, 155, 161, 22, 230, 251, 216, 235, 87, 229, 159, 201, 213, 31, 39, 8, 216, 7, 242, 170, 237, 182, 45, 77, 216, 240, 7, 63, 152, 255, 0, 235, 211, 148, 109, 96, 76, 17, 55, 64, 51, 33, 207, 166, 106, 163, 151, 87, 35, 115, 113, 239, 86, 163, 155, 16, 183, 60, 47, 4, 154, 168, 193, 139, 150, 36, 126, 52, 158, 172, 171, 232, 110, 233, 179, 121, 176, 144, 79, 204, 184, 6, 138, 131, 69, 235, 55, 252, 7, 250, 209, 85, 53, 105, 16, 138, 250, 138, 147, 123, 33, 3, 211, 249, 10, 128, 130, 210, 2, 224, 146, 6, 15, 189, 20, 86, 147, 248, 16, 150, 224, 19, 158, 71, 203, 77, 117, 221, 33, 32, 124, 180, 81, 88, 20, 104, 232, 192, 143, 59, 62, 223, 214, 138, 40, 171, 150, 226, 71]",m,320.0,314.0,20235.0,x,592.0,580.0,"[4397, 10358, 16789, 24201, 39145]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We are living in an era in which international politics and the threat of full-fledged global war appear to laypeople to be more like fun and a computer game than a dire disaster.They are scared, but in the depth of their hearts they would love to see this happen. 

To expect China to down the jet of Nancy Pelosi was quite insane, since that would mean direct aggression against the United States. Beijing is wise enough not to hand Washington such trump cards. However, the visit itself took place despite the endless requests and warnings from China. Thus, Sino-American relations were significantly damaged. The fact that the US doesn’t respect any state’s national interests unless they match their own is common knowledge. Now it has just another proof. For the US to make this visit happen, despite the White House's attempts to disown that visit, is obviously a part of the game and a way to demonstrate the US might and to show China its place according to the US estimations and US concept of the globe. It's very unlikely that China will agree with these estimations. I can assume as well that Taiwan is becoming a kind of blackmailing instrument: Taiwan in return for abandoning the Beijing-Moscow partnership. This might be attractive to the part of the CCP establishment that is pro-US (in the sense of pro-business and pro-big money). But that is unacceptable for the opposite camp, to which belongs Xi Jinping himself, that is pro-China, pro-multipolar world and pro-independence of the country.

However, the current developments and the way Washington treats China are likely to reconcile the CCP party from within and force it to find compromises since the US moves significantly damage Chinese national pride and eloquently reveal the US approach and far-reaching plans (multiplied by the NATO expansion in Asia and NATO’s new strategic concept that defined China as a “systematic challenge” to the Alliance). And the declared intentions of the US and the signals they send about how far things might go. The key point that the whole CCP unconditionally agrees on is that: «Taiwan is China». Furthermore, it is important to bear in mind that the CCP can’t leave the current game launched by the US without a response, since in the eyes of the Chinese people this will be considered a weakness and will likely undermine their trust in the leadership. 

China has announced unprecedented military drills around Taiwan and in the Taiwanese territorial waters with missile launches that are supposed to fly through the Taiwanese airspace. Approximately 200 000 PLA military personnel have been placed on alert. 
In the case of the assault, scenario we can’t dismiss, that would be a provoked assault on Taiwan, not on Pelosi or the US. And if so, that would be a big question if the US took a risk and militarily responded to China. If they went for sanctions, the option they love the most, the consequences would be more catastrophic for the Western world and its economy than for China.

Will China take a risk and militarily restore control over Taiwan? It is hard to predict, though if it doesn’t do that now, it is unlikely that Taiwan will ever be Chinese again.

What are China’s non-military options? China might consider imposing a partial or fulscale ban on trade with Taiwan, which is majorly dependent on China, and encircling it in the ring of the blockade. At least the map of the military drills gives such a perception. 

No matter the further moves of Beijing, the US will continue playing with fire. And what is really definite is what Xi Jinping said to Biden in their latest phone call: ""Those who play with fire will eventually get burned.""",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,8421.0,36.0,,,,[],,MessageMediaWebPage,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityTextUrl,0.0,1.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,109.0,46.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,1968.0,22.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,2037.0,49.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,2551.0,29.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,3556.0,54.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,3784.0,51.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,101.0,,,,,,,,MessageReplies,0.0,25478.0,False,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WebPage,5.081221151880889e+18,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1726574262.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The maximum age of those who can be recruited during the mobilization campaign in Ukraine is now 70 years. Some time ago it was 55, then it was 60 and now 70. That is a pity, of course, but I can explain why. When almost all young and adult men up to 50 years old have already fled the country, there are only senior citizens left. Moreover, when your army suffers unacceptable losses, making old and mostly weak due to bad health people die for nothing. That is basically why Mr. Zelensky does what he does.

▪️Putin quoted Stolypin: ""In the matter of defending Russia, we all must unite, coordinate our efforts, our duties and our rights to maintain one historical supreme right - the right of Russia to be strong""
▪️Russia was handed over to us by our ancestors, but we need to preserve it and pass it on.
Nothing can replace the school of military operations, people come out of their differences and are ready to lay down their lives for the Fatherland, Putin believes.
▪️The main pillar in the development of new regions of the Russian Federation should be those who were born and raised there, who fought for these lands, the president said.
▪️The level of equipping the nuclear deterrence forces with the latest weapons is 91.3%, it is necessary to reach this level in all areas of the Armed Forces.
▪️Those who embarked on the path of betrayal of Russia will be held accountable under the law, but we will not organize a ""witch hunt"".

Message,105996,1731758208,,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"Macron, at the beginning of the yellow vests movement, also had to make sure police would stay loyal to him, leading to nowadays’s situation where police will only partially listen to civilian government’s orders, and won’t hesitate to sack a minister that doesn’t listen to their demands.

Then, Macron’s policy was all about preventing further social unrests. He made several openings towards the right-wing, notably adopting his separatism bill which effectively put islam under state supervision. He also kept postponing his retirement pension reforms.

We can also note how Macron adopted the ""quoi qu’il en coute"" policy, making the state spend a lot of money during the COVID and energy crisis, leading to France being warned by IMF to reduce spending.

Macron, during the energy crisis, went as far as to make sure ordinary people’s gas prices would stay the same during the winter, making the state pay the difference.

Now, as businesses such as bakeries are also afraid of shutting down, Macron is according to media reports getting ready to bail them out too.

Having a Western, liberal democratic leader having to spend so much time actively trying not to be overthrown is unprecedented. Macron won 2 presidential elections being first on the first ballot and winning a landslide on the runoff. Currently, according to polls, Macron’s popularity is over 40%.

Normally, democracies are kept alive by popular support and autocracies are kept alive by a mix of repression and buying people’s support. Macron’s France is increasingly becoming an exception, and a democracy whose fundamental survival tricks increasingly resembles those of an authoritarian regime. 

Obviously, as Macron made concessions, he became more popular. Macron is way more popular now than 5 years ago when he was seen as a new Hollande. But what’s the point of being popular if you can’t genuinely do your policy priorities and you must keep appeasing factions that might try to remove you from power?

Macron once said that the king’s figure was missing in French politics. That’s something a lot of French people, including normal and from the elites, believe up to a point. French people want a democracy, but at the same time wants a strong regime. 

Talking about kings, Louis XIV’s reign was always marked by the revolt, the ""Fronde"" that happened while he was still a child. This led Louis XIV to centralize the monarchy further , becoming the famous absolutist he was during his reign.

🇫🇷 - There is a lot of chatter in France about how ""French people are sheep that never revolt"". In France, having this kind of rhetoric is very common. 

Having a retirement age at 62, France is the Western state (excluding states that were East of the Iron Curtain during the cold war for the end of the discussion) that has the lowest retirement age. At retirement age of 64 as propose Macron's reform, it would still be the case.

Obviously, the reform is massively unpopular. However, Macron can afford it as he is in his second term and will be term-limited in 2027. 

LR seems to be somewhat comfortable with the reform as long as a few concessions are awarded, so it will likely succeed even if Macron's movement doesn't have a majority in parliament. 

The reason why France has and will still retain the lowest retirement age in the West? Because doing ""radical"" liberal economic reforms cause protests, strikes and riots and this deter governments from doing them.

🇫🇷 - Macron talks about having been elected and so he's legitimate to pass his reforms. There is some truth to his point, but he's missing one key point:

Macron was elected twice in a country where:

1) Nearly all the media supported him
2) Openly supporting the opposition candidate often lead to social ostracism
3) Cases of political violences targeting the opposition supporters were recorded.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReplyHeader,105973.0,,104473.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-ukrainewarchatroom_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Political scientist Alexei Zhivov @zhivoff especially for the channel ""Soroka-Beloboka"" @soroka_belaya

After the ""cold shower"" of the start of a special military operation, many key experts reconsidered their attitude towards the Ukrainian army and Western weapons. Previously, there was an opinion that Western weapons do not pose a serious threat, and the Ukrainian army does not exist at all.

The results ""on the ground"" made us take a different look at the issues raised, and many publicists rushed to the other extreme. Each tactical success of the Armed Forces of Ukraine began to be elevated to the level of ""victory on the Kursk Bulge."" Moreover, the Russian society began to react to the numerous stuffings from the Ukranian Center of Information and Psychological Operations, producing unfounded fears.

What about in reality? How many ""overcomes"" did the Armed Forces of Ukraine win, and how many did we made up by ourselves for them?

At the beginning of the special military operation, there were several tangible blows against the advancing Russian troops, which led to significant losses in people and equipment. First of all, Kharkov comes to mind. The liberation of Mariupol ended with very heavy fighting. The Armed Forces of Ukraine were able to organize resistance near Kyiv. And, perhaps, everything.

The withdrawal of Russian troops from Kyiv and from the north of Ukraine is the decision of our authorities. At the time the command arrived, the special forces were already working within the city. The Izyum offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine demoralized both society and the army, but the reasons were, again, domestic. Exactly the same offensives in the Kherson region bogged down, burying thousands of Ukrainian solders in the Kherson black soil. Withdrawal from the right bank of the Dnieper is also a political decision. The army successfully coped with the offensive, although it experienced a shortage of supplies.

Where did the myth about the victorious march of the Armed Forces of Ukraine come from? The Ukrainian army has indeed achieved some success, but certainly not in offensive operations. Their forte is defense, primarily urban. Our army ran into it in the Donbass. Cities in eastern Ukraine were prepared in advance for defense ""to the last whole wall.""

The Reich at one time defeated France with lightning speed, simply bypassing the impregnable Maginot Line from the rear. Unfortunately, the Russian army did not succeed in such a maneuver, largely due to the initial underestimation of the situation and hope for a political resolution of the issue. I think if the military operation was originally planned without regard to political instruments and inappropriate humanism, the Armed Forces of Ukraine would not have had a chance.

Most of the victories of the Ukrainian army are a direct consequence of mistakes in the planning and implementation of the operation to liberate Novorossia and Donbass. Ukraine was able to impose urban battles on the Russian army, for which our army was not ready either morally or technically. All the successes of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are associated exclusively with defensive work: the use of artillery and flexible defense, as well as a viscous fight in concrete fortified areas. We have faced a worthy adversary, but the myth about the strength and invincibility of the Ukrainian army is a delusion.

A delusion that was dispelled with the help of morally unstable Russian media with the active support of Ukrainian channels and speakers. The depression of society after the Izyum-Kherson regrouping at some point reached such intensity that people seriously believed in Ukrainian plans to attack Crimea.

In the bottom line, Ukraine was unable to return any of its regions on its own. And its maximum is to contain the smaller Russian army at the cost of colossal losses in manpower and equipment.

I also stated(not in that comment) that crypto is largely unstable due to it being backed by nothing. As far as government currencies having investors to spread risk I think that statement is inherently flawed, there is no true investor in the currencies mainly because they are no longer backed on anything, all fiat currencies are largely based on emotion, you can see this occur when revolutions are about to occur and investors pull out of that country and the currency is devalued and inflation rises. This could be a proactive measure on the part of that government but likely there is little faith left in that currency. Hence why you said bullets are your go to in an ""apocalyptic"" scenario. The true value would not be in having bullets but having the knowledge to create them.

With money, as explicitly stated, it is the love of money that is the root of all evil.  But actually, money is just an agreement.  

I was waiting for someone to make this argument.  And it is true that even supposedly stable government currencies have become worthless.  However, nothing stable backs crypto and that is why it is imaginary.  It exists only as long as people keep putting money into it, and believing it exists.  There are not enough investors to spread risk, as with large government currencies.  So it can and has collapsed virtually overnight simply because too many people at once in a very small pool stopped believing it. 

For me personally?  If I really and truly wanted to put as many assets possible into the most recession proof, high demand, practical commodity on earth I would invest in physical ammo.  It wouldn’t matter what else people were using for barter.  At that point you would have the single thing everyone wanted more than anything. 

So, I know these are jackoff convos and they are also international which makes them interesting.  Aside from the cuckoos, what people are anxious about.  Reminds me of US prepper groups a little minus the crypto when they talk SHTF or worse scenarios.

In a wide-ranging conversation at his compound in Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky tells The Atlantic what Ukraine needs to survive — and describes the price it has paid.

""It was late in the evening when we met Zelensky at his compound. The surrounding streets were barricaded and empty, the building itself almost entirely blacked out. Soldiers with flashlights led us through a maze of sandbagged corridors to a harshly lit, windowless room adorned only with Ukrainian flags 🇺🇦

Message,615,1610060648,,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"WW3 is not happening. 
Putin is not invading Ukraine. 
Putin is taking out deep state black op bio labs with precision strikes, who have been trying to create killer diseases right on Russia's border. 
Ukraine is a stronghold for money laundering and the Biden crime family will be exposed with information coming out.  
This couldnt happen under Trump as its bad optics and the media love nothing more than to try to get Trump and Putin to fight.
Zelensky (a Ukrainian Trump who was elected) is in on this too, but will do the optics dance. 
Putin will come out with a peace deal soon. 
Those of us who do pay attention to what happens on our planet know that Putin is an enemy of the Globalists and is well aware of the Deep State presence in Ukraine. 
This all goes back to when the Neo Nazis took more control after the Maidan Square massacre about 8-9 years ago, where the deep state used snipers on roofs to wreak havoc. 
China will kick off with Taiwan next like Trump told us.
Like I have been saying all along Trump , Putin and Xi are covertly working together to take out the deep state cabal. 
You are watching a show. 
The MSM will hype this all up and make people believe that WW3 is imminent, which is complete fake news. 
The end result will be the exposing of the CIA's role in ""the virus"" as an attack on USA and China via Fauci leaked emails. 
This will expose the CIA's funding of the CCP, Big Pharma and to the normies, that yes there is such a thing as the cabal.
Xi is like a Trump, and is not an ally of the CCP. 
Xi was told not to bring Trump to the forbidden city when Trump visted but Xi did it anyway, which was such a huge deal as no one is allowed in the forbidden city , especially not someone from the West. 
The Chinese people will soon be free.  
This song and dance and show had to happen this way because your sheeple family and friends were too cowardly to wake up by themselves and refused to research or even question things even after the entire planet of healthy people were locked inside their homes because the media rebranded the flu and they were forced to get eperimental Big Pharma vaccines to live life, for the first time in history.
Our planet can never be allowed get this ignorant again. 
It is shameful , especially by the Western men whose chosen ignorance will be studied for eons.
God bless the Truth Bombers all around the world fighting for humanity. 
Our victory is inevitable.
