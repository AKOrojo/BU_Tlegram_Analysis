Message,17884,1639836943,2023-02-06T14:10:18+00:00,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"📈 Russian economy forecast has been improved

IMF has stated that it has increased estimates of Russian economy growth from –2.3% contraction to 0.3% growth in 2023 despite a broad array of Western sanctions.

The IMF attributes this improvement to Russia finding new clients outside the West by redirecting trade from sanctioning to non-sanctioning countries. Activity of Russian defense industrial complex was one of the main contributors for projected growth.

These are good news, as we know that Western forecasts never favor Russia. Last year they forecasted collapse of Russian economy, then they stated that it will not return to growth until second half of 2020s, then it was 2024 and now it has already happened.

It looks like IMF reluctantly acknowledged amazingly quick recovery of Russian economy to add credibility to its other forecasts, such as the one concerning Europe. Yes, you heard it right, they forecast that European economy will grow in 2023. Despite it having far deeper problems than Russia. 

The thing is that Russia had to find customers for its export products, which are in very high demand. This was not really a problem as long as two thirds of the world didn’t join Western sanctions or simply ignored them. 

European problem is different, they need to find resources, especially energy. Amid looming energy crisis and soaring prices that are expected to come this year when Chinese reopening gains momentum, their chances to get a good deal are slim. 

For now, Europe is still living on Russian resources, despite all of their nice words. They are getting them from intermediary countries while some are coming directly from Russia. There is physically no way to replace Russian supplies and maintain European industry competitive, so all growth forecasts are likely to be artificial. 

There is a fundamental flaw in IMF estimations of economic growth. They estimate this growth in US dollars, and it is no longer a stable currency as it once used to be. 

Moreover, the rate of USD and EUR is greatly inflated and as these currencies are slowly but steadily losing relevance for international trade, estimates in these currencies are no longer objective. More objective are estimations based on purchasing power of currency and not on its market rate to USD. 

If we estimate things by purchasing power parity, we’ll see that Russian economy is actually twice stronger than it seems to the West, and so its growth is far better than anyone could guess. For reference, while market exchange rate is around $1 = 70 rubles, purchasing power rate is under 30 rubles per dollar.

Fortunately for Russia, dollar rate has little impact on its economy and influences only foreign trade. As Russia is readjusting its import-export flows, higher dollar rate means that Russia earns more money through export and can afford to import more goods, which translates into lower consumer prices. 

A fun fact, prices on modern notebooks in Russia fell by 25 percent since last October due to competition of parallel import and Chinese manufacturers trying to enter the lucrative Russian market. So, Russia is fine. Can’t say that of Europe.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,4223.0,5.0,2023-02-06T14:11:44+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,47.0,MessageEntityBold,211.0,251.0,MessageEntityBold,1501.0,170.0,MessageEntityBold,1827.0,167.0,MessageEntityBold,2617.0,102.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,567.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,567.0,,,,,MessageReplies,14.0,25478.0,False,[],,18084.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Message,17111,1639836943,2022-12-29T14:01:07+00:00,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"⬛️ According to recent report in Financial Times, almost 90 percent of surveyed economists expect that energy shortage will trigger eurozone contraction in 2023. 

Experts acknowledge that European economy is already in recession and it will intensify next year even more. High inflation and energy shortage push a strong pressure on EU industry, salary increases are falling short behind inflation, consumer demand falls and this is triggering a chain reaction that will manifest most noticeably in the coming year.

This report greatly contradicts optimistic statements of European politicians, which in fact turn to be quite void. This year Europe managed to reduce its energy consumption by 20 percent. But how was it achieved? Despite widely publicized household energy-saving measures, they account just for a tiny bit of energy consumption. Expensive transition to energy-efficient technologies also helped a tiny bit, but the lion’s share of energy saving is due to reduced consumption by European industry. 

Plants are reducing production, businesses close, companies see lower profits and are looking for ways to cut costs. Facing much higher energy costs and falling demand they are virtually forced to “optimize” labor costs, resulting in even more unemployment, even lower demand and so on.

For many decades European industry was considered innovative and competitive, for many years European income level was considered relatively high as compared to most other countries. We knew that a good part of high income was compensated with high costs of living, but we thought that aside for that best European countries are really demonstrating outstanding competence in running their economies. 

However, it turned out that all of this was just an illusion and the real foundation of European competitiveness was very simple — cheap Russian energy that it was getting from USSR and later Russia. With few exceptions such as Norway that has its own energy resources, the competitiveness of Europe was dependent on Russian energy and it was an incredible level of dependence that nobody could even imagine.

Energy prices impact industry not only directly through the energy it consumes but also indirectly through increased prices on components and higher costs of storage and transportation. Even slight increase in energy prices has multiplicative effect on manufacturing costs of final product. 

Now just think, Europe now pays 2-4 times more for its energy. Consumer sector is subsidized, but subsidies won’t work for industry. Paying billions to subsidize companies and getting back millions in taxes does not sound like a plan. It can work for a short period, but European pockets are not endless and the crisis spiral is already in motion. 

In face of inevitable increase of global demand for energy, the Eurozone sees itself in completely uncompetitive position. The euro bubble will sooner or later burst out, and European authorities can do little to prevent it.

Still, it can be a good sign for Europe as well. When Europe shifts to survival mode, there is a good chance that hardships will finally open the eyes of European people and they will kick out globalist talking heads out and elect new generation politicians out of more reasonable people.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,3086.0,6.0,2022-12-29T14:20:10+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,270.0,MessageEntityBold,1018.0,115.0,MessageEntityBold,1709.0,199.0,MessageEntityBold,2475.0,69.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,535.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,535.0,,,,,MessageReplies,10.0,25478.0,False,[],,17122.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Massive Russian strikes over Ukrainian energy grid with missiles and drones have virtually achieved their results. The power grid is down and this seriously hinders mobility of enemy forces, supplies and whatever is left of Ukrainian arms industry.

While Zelensky’s regime is trying to pretend that nothing serious has happened, they have already prohibited citizens talk about blackouts publicly. They pretend that those without electricity are a part of “the unfortunate 1 percent”. That’s their usual math, the one they use to calculate casualties, secure financial aid and so on. 

Kiev rulers are acting as if they have already secured victory, and this makes sense for them — nobody will send money to losers and extracting money from the West is becoming the favorite sport of Zelensky and Co.

They are virtually forcing citizens to stay at cities without stable supply of power, hot water and central heating. They lie because they need to show a nice picture to their sponsors. We have always known that well-being of civilians has zero relevance to Kiev regime, they have already proven it with there endless shelling of Donbass. 

▪️By the way, that shelling still continues — while people in the West were watching FIFA World Cup, Ukrainian artillery have launched a massive strike against civilian hospital in Donetsk that involved casualties. It was just the last of the series of similar strikes against residential buildings, temples, cafes and other civilian infrastructure. 

These strikes have no military sense, there were no military objects or armed forces in the vicinity of impacted areas. In fact, they perfectly fit definition of war crime. Moreover, Ukraine still claims Donetsk to be its territory but it does not have any concerns about people that it wants to return… or not. In fact, it’s common knowledge that Ukraine just wants those rich lands, no people needed. 

▪️The Ukrainian regime enforces “stay home” agenda for several reasons, and the main reason is that if Zelensky allows people to leave, Ukraine will get empty. EU will face another migration crisis while it hasn’t even barely accommodated to the previous one. Several more millions of Ukrainian migrants in EU will inevitably cause an explosion among local people and they will start looking for someone responsible. 

▪️Zelensky is too minor figure to answer for all European problems but his helpers are still around —EU parliament, EU government, leaders of EU countries. All those proponents of “solidarity with Ukraine” who decided that a chance for a victorious war is worth suffering of their people. No way.

EU Parliament has finally noticed the looming economic problems and potential loss of competitiveness of European industry. On Thursday, December 15 they are planning to discuss measures that can be taken to address the dire situation that the EU faces in short-term, mid-term and long-term perspective. 

Sanctions against Russia can indeed be compared to shooting oneself in a leg. While Russia did not really notice their impact, Europe is now facing one of the hardest challenges for its economy in all its history. As energy prices have soared, more and more large European businesses are looking to move their industrial facilities overseas. 

The United States have longed opposed cooperation between Russia and Europe in energy sector. Inexpensive Russian pipeline gas brought European industry incredible competitive advantages that negated disadvantages of high cost of labor and high tax burden. Moreover, it enabled many European industries such as the car industry to successfully compete with American enterprises at foreign markets that the U.S. considers their own playground. 

Now Europe finally got rid of its dependence on “non-democratic” Russian gas, and is no longer dependent on Russia. According to recent revelations of Werner Steinecker, ex-CEO of Austrian Energie AG, EU has signed 20-year LNG supply contracts with the United States based on “take or pay” formula that met such a harsh critics in Europe when it was used by Russia.

This means that European Union will have to pay the United States any “market price” just to meet their basic demands. Costs of energy are already rising and they are not so noticeable by European consumers only because of government subsidies. 

▪️Moreover, U.S. subsidies of their own industry may deal the last stroke to competitiveness of Europe although their long-term impact on U.S. economy is also controversial. European countries have little to do in response except for taking similar measures. 

France has proposed unrestricted subsidies to European industrial enterprises and this proposal is supported by many other EU countries with notable exception of Scandinavia that suffers less from the energy crisis. 

▪️The problem with industrial subsidies is that while they can give short-term boost to industry, they are not viable in long term. Subsidies can help create new industries, subsidies can help in production of critical things, but they cannot make industry competitive. 

European subsidies will effectively mean that European industry will yield losses to subsidizing countries. Competitiveness means low costs and European states will have to pay all the time to keep those costs low or face exodus of industry to other regions. This will put an end to relative wealth of the European Union.

🔴 Is there another way? Sure, they can resume their contracts with Russia. Will Russia agree on that? Unlikely. Too many things have been said and done to make it easy. Europe will have to pay if it wants to restore ties. Russia will not come begging for mercy, but if Europe will, they still have a chance to save themselves from turning into a third world region.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1998.0,4.0,2022-12-16T11:16:16+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,48.0,MessageEntityBold,175.0,182.0,MessageEntityBold,435.0,134.0,MessageEntityBold,1146.0,367.0,MessageEntityBold,2511.0,352.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,506.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,506.0,,,,,MessageReplies,2.0,25478.0,False,[],,16775.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Message,16736,1639836943,2022-12-14T13:00:41+00:00,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"🟥 According to CNN, the United States have finally decided to send Patriot air defense batteries to Ukraine and it may happen as soon as this week. The decision has yet to be approved by U.S. Secretary of Defense and President Biden but there are no reasons to believe that such approval will be withheld.

Patriot battery consists of radar, computers, power generating equipment, engagement control station and up to eight launchers each holding four ready to fire missiles. Systems will allegedly be delivered to U.S. bases in Germany where Ukrainian operators will be trained to use them.

▪️This decision will definitely trigger many questions. First of all, a Patriot battery is not a simple system, it requires a dozens of trained personnel that have to work in coordination. Training such an operator is not a matter of days or even weeks, it would take months. Months is not something that Ukraine can afford, so training is likely to be a profanation and the systems will be actually operated by NATO military.

▪️Secondly, there is the issue of generations. The U.S. does not specify age of the systems that will be supplied, type of missiles they are adapted to and their capabilities. Older generations of Patriots are worse than Soviet S-300 currently used by Ukraine, latest generation is slightly better but there is also the issue of numbers. One battery won’t change anything for Ukraine, just as ten or even twenty batteries. There is also an issue of price — one battery costs $1 billion and one missile costs $3 million.

🔺Do the U.S. have capability to supply a significant volume of missiles? The answer is no. U.S. doesn’t have enough Patriot missiles even for sale. When Saudi Arabia has depleted its stocks of missiles in Yemen conflict, they had to ask other Arab countries as the U.S. rejected the order. Lockheed Martin announced plans to increase missile production, however this expansion will take years and won’t match the numbers that Russia is producing per month.

🔺Now, should Russia worry? Not really. Patriot systems have performed poorly in Saudi Arabia against missiles and drones used by Yemen. Even a hundred of such systems with full stocks of missiles for months would not guarantee Ukraine full protection. 

They are incompatible with Ukrainian air defense systems and can be operated only by NATO personnel. U.S. cannot really send many batteries and provide even remotely enough missiles to counter different types of cruise missiles, drones and decoys used by Russian military. 

Russian intelligence is not blind and surely Russian command understands what would be the impact of destroying US-supplied batteries and they will definitely be made priority targets. PAC 3 does have limited hypersonic interception capabilities, but it is much more likely that US batteries will just become a perfect target for testing latest Russian hypersonic missiles.  

U.S. command understands it as well, so it’s possible that those systems will never really get to Ukraine. If the U.S. will indeed train Ukrainian operators, it will take many months. Ukraine does not have this time. Or rather, Ukraine should not have this time and Russia has to take care of it.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1935.0,4.0,2022-12-14T13:10:08+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,305.0,MessageEntityBold,870.0,152.0,MessageEntityBold,1198.0,83.0,MessageEntityBold,1545.0,71.0,MessageEntityBold,2002.0,27.0,MessageEntityBold,2257.0,275.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,503.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,503.0,,,,,MessageReplies,2.0,25478.0,False,[],,16808.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bloomberg as well at the whole lot of Western mainstream media reported that it was a sudden decision made as the result of new nuclear threats made by Russian president on December 7th. 

▪️ Did Vladimir Putin really come up with nuclear threats or anything that can be interpreted as that? No. He specifically stated that Russian nuclear strategy has defensive purpose and Russian nuclear weapons are going to be used only as response to attacks. 

“We are not crazy, we understand what nuclear weapons are. We have them, and they are more advanced and innovative than those of any other country. It is an obvious fact.” — said Vladimir Putin at the meeting with President’s Human Rights Council adding that nuclear weapons are “not a factor that provokes escalation but a restrictive factor”. 

Western campaign of lies continues and they are doing everything in their power to slander Russia and its President presenting them as some maniacs threatening the whole world with nuclear weapons. In last four months Russian President has not voiced any direct threats about potential use of nuclear weapons, he even said that directly as response to numerous false accusations that came in September and October.

▪️ Their lies are not sophisticated and can be easily debunked by simply checking on actual transcripts of speeches and interviews of Russian President, Kremlin’s public relations office and statements of senior officials. All this information is available and moreover, most of it is translated into English, so audience of the global media can easily verify it.

The problem is that a huge part of this audience does not want to verify anything. They just read information and believe it. They are not doing fact-checking, they are not reading debunks, they are not doubting “reputable media”. 

This works not only in the West, but also in the third world, where “progressive” people are proud of learning to speak English and read English-language news. Many of them are as blind to numerous flaws of the Western media that appeared and grown like a cancer within the course of past two-three decades. 

▪️ Of course, Narendra Modi cancelled his meeting with Russian leader for a different reason. They have recently met in person in September, they had a lot of phone calls this year and next year India is hosting G20 summit and Modi has personally invited Vladimir Putin to visit New Delhi. 

Modi does support Russia in its conflict with the West, which is already a big surprise and another achievement of Russian diplomacy. In fact, India is now extending support by supplying Russia with more equipment and raw materials and increasing volumes of oil import from Russia.

Western media deliberately created lies in an attempt to deteriorate relations between Russia and India. Indian media have already publicly debunked this fake story and Russian media space largely ignored that matter altogether. It’s so surprising that Bloomberg and the rest can openly lie with the intention to impact global political matters and get away with it — no multi-million fines, no lawsuits, just nothing.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1945.0,7.0,2022-12-12T13:07:14+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,398.0,MessageEntityItalic,557.0,347.0,MessageEntityBold,1320.0,365.0,MessageEntityBold,1918.0,158.0,MessageEntityBold,2228.0,292.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,496.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,496.0,,,,,MessageReplies,3.0,25478.0,False,[],,16712.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As time passes by, Western countries intensify their verbal support of Ukraine but weapon supplies to Ukraine are getting lower, countries of the collective West are almost out of stock and are scrapping for last bits of this and that everywhere. There are even talks of unearthing some reserves of old Soviet weapons stocked by Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi and sending these to Ukrainians. 

European countries are plunging deeper and deeper into economic crisis and the U.S. is stepping over their heads instead of stretching a helping hand to them. Controversial economic measures such as oil price caps do not help stabilization of global economy and China is securing far better deals in the Middle East than EU.

❗️The United States have already achieved their objective to deindustrialize Europe, strip it of competitive advantage in form of cheap Russian energy and lure European capitals and companies into U.S. jurisdictions. 

It is becoming obvious that end of the Ukrainian conflict will not be the end of conflict between Russia and the West and this conflict known as Cold War 2.0. will in fact only intensify after the end of the hot phase.

🔴 But what are the objectives of the U.S.-led collective West for this hot phase? 

There is only one big objective and only one chance for their side to win — installing a puppet regime in Russia. Since Russia is a nuclear superpower, this cannot be done from outside, so they used several different tactical approaches to try and achieve that.

First, they wanted to shock Russia with sanctions and cripple its economy. That is why they forced Ukraine to resist from the very beginning instead of immediate surrender. 

By summer, when Russian economy has recovered from the initial shock and showed unprecedented results, the collective West to a new method — increase military pressure. Mass supply of weapons, instructors, mercenaries and money did bring Ukraine some interim successes, however setbacks never made in impact on solidarity of Russian people with the government. 

When it turned clear that military victory is impossible, some Western politicians and military started getting around with the idea of freezing the conflict luring the Russian government into a trap of a temporary ceasefire agreement, so called “Minsk 3”. Russian public was indeed worried about possible ceasefire agreement on unfavorable term but Kremlin was firm in its position to fulfil all SMO objectives. 

❗️In fact, this uncertainty could last much longer, but Angela Merkel did a big service to Russia by revealing the true intention of previous Minsk Agreements — to win time and militarize Ukraine. Vladimir Putin expressed doubts on whether it is possible to achieve any agreements and what would guarantee them although said that some agreement is eventually inevitable.

The collective West failed to achieve quick victory and incite a regime change in Russia. They may resort to more plans but their support heavily depends on situation on the ground and their own capabilities, which are dwindling day after day. 

Russian tactics is working and there are many signs showing that Ukrainian state is close to collapse. Continued pressure will force the collective West to choose between sharing defeat with Ukraine or settling on the profit.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1992.0,7.0,2022-12-12T07:49:02+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,30.0,MessageEntityBold,280.0,152.0,MessageEntityBold,758.0,219.0,MessageEntityBold,1197.0,158.0,MessageEntityBold,1889.0,194.0,MessageEntityBold,2501.0,369.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,494.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,494.0,,,,,MessageReplies,9.0,25478.0,False,[],,16721.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Russian Vice Prime Minister Novak has already declared that Russia is not going to give in and acknowledge any price caps and that Russia will cease supplies to any countries that will implement these restrictions and will either redirect supplies to market-oriented countries or reduce its oil production.

📞 Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday in a phone call with Prime Minister of Iraq that all Western attempts to impose price caps on Russian oil will lead to heavy consequences for the entire world. Kremlin website says:

 “Discussion also covered situation with attempts of a number of Western countries to impose restrictions on prices of oil materials supplied by Russia. Vladimir Putin stressed that such actions contradict the principles of free market and will highly likely result in heavy consequences for the global energy market.”

➖The impact of potential price caps on oil and gas market depends on actual price caps that will be established. While highest proposed range is way above current market prices and is unlikely to impact any supplies, the lowest range that is championed by some of the most Russophobe countries will inevitably result in global shortage of fossil fuels and will push prices up. 

➖While this discussion has little practical relevance to the U.S., European countries are literally deciding their own fate. Shall they implement those price caps, they will deprive themselves of all chances to revive European industry. Indeed, the situation with industrial production in Europe is becoming more and more dire, existing projects are suspended and stalled while new projects look for sites in Asia where production costs are going to be much lower. 

➖Leading EU countries keep subsidizing their industry and economy but they cannot do it forever as their wealth and credit indeed depend on their industrial might. However, they have little options because of the need to subsidize many other things and primarily the consumer and utilities sectors to get Europeans through the winter.

➖ This is yet another unprecedented and completely unsubstantiated statement that is probably backed by own ideas of those officials about what they would do in similar situation. However, simply dismissing it is not a very good idea.

➖This practice of “information injection” was commonly used to prepare Western public opinion to similar accusations against leaders of other countries such as Iraq, Syria and Lybia. We have already seen how single unverified media publications eventually culminated in invasion and destruction of whole countries. 

❗️ The whole world remembers the story with a vial of detergent that ultimately resulted in destruction of all Iraq cities and infrastructure, murder of its president and the rise of one of the most notorious terrorist organizations. That story also started with media reports and anonymous sources.

☝️ So, if this publication is followed by more such works, it is worth considering it a “red flag”, a sign that some kind of provocation involving chemical weapons is being prepared in Ukraine. Ukraine’s regime and Western warmongers supporting it are desperately looking for excuses to trigger direct intervention of NATO in the conflict, as it is the only way to prevent Ukraine’s collapse and capitulation. 

➖The “dirty bomb” story has been exposed by Russia and lost its potential impact, although it’s still to early to completely dismiss the probability of such provocation. The “missiles in Poland” story was way too crude and was probably the initiative of Ukrainian authorities and not their Western sponsors.

➖However, the “chemical weapon” story perfectly fits in typical modus operandi of the collective West. Ukraine has enough experienced actors that have been seen in numerous videos of “Russian atrocities”, so they could easily stage a “chemical attack” of any scale. Moreover, Kiev regime is not known for having mercy or caring at least a little bit about its citizens, so they could really use it against their own troops, especially on forces with questionable loyalty. 
The best course of action for Russia would be to bring up global attention to these rumors. It worked with the dirty bomb, especially when Russia provided details of the planned provocation. However, even if Russian intelligence doesn’t get any confirmation or specific information about “chemical provocation”, it’s still worth being on high alert about such things.

In last few days some Russian Telegram channels have been talking a lot about a possibility of second wave of mobilization that may start this winter after completion of autumn draft. Although the government has already announced that mobilization is over, this may still be a possibility. Let’s not speculate on whether it is probable or not but review some pros and cons of this initiative:

👍 Pro: Social media surveys show that 92.6 percent of respondents are expecting a new wave of mobilization and 49.3% are ready to serve the country as mobilized and volunteers (one third of survey participants were females). This means that a large part of Russian men are ready and willing to serve the country and that meeting mobilization targets will not present any problems, just like it happened with the first wave. 

👎 Con: The first wave of mobilization included the best reservists with the most demanded military specializations. However, a large part of mobilized reservists is still undergoing training and it is not deployed at front lines. 

👍 Pro: Training and supplying mobilized forces takes time. It took more than a month to complete the first wave. A large part of newly mobilized forces needed only refresher training, however with the following waves situation may be different. Therefore, such measures need to be taken well in advance before forces are actually needed on the front. They can even be dismissed after training, but it’s better to have reserves and don’t need them rather than have no reserves when they are needed.

👎 Con: Military commissions work in non-stop overload mode. They organized spring draft, then mobilization, then autumn draft. Mobilization in winter right before spring draft will increase the load even further, and this may manifest in mistakes. The first wave showed some flaws in their work, but it takes time to fix those flaws.

👍 Pro: Even when all mobilized reservists and volunteers from the first wave will arrive at the front, Kiev regime will still have numeric advantage. Of course, quality matters and casualty rate between Russian and Ukrainian forces shows that, but it is much easier to launch offensive operations with numeric superiority and Russia does need to go on the offense. 

👎 Con: Russia is currently using advanced weapons such as missiles to fight attrition war against the enemy. Missile strike on energy grid and other dual-purpose facilities are yielding good results and Kiev regime is close to collapse despite all Western aid.

👍 Pro: Even if Ukraine collapses, Russian forces will be needed to maintain order, suppress resistance, eliminate marauders and complete denazification.

👎 Con: While military mobilization is important, it will impact the economy. Mobilization of industry is as much important and maybe this should be the next priority of the government.

❗️The government will have many factors to consider when making the decision and Russian people hope that they will come to the best decision in light of all the above pros and cons as well as other considerations.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1899.0,2.0,2022-11-21T12:00:59+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,55.0,MessageEntityBold,347.0,105.0,MessageEntityItalic,2921.0,214.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,443.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,443.0,,,,,MessageReplies,5.0,25478.0,False,[],,15747.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most important thing is that Russia doesn’t have the problem of rising costs. The very idea of sanctions was based on assumption that Russian economy largely depends on import from the West and will fail to meet demand if the West cuts the ties. 

➖However, this wasn’t the case as someone forgot to account for one important thing. When a British company owns a factory in Russia, it’s not a British factory. When this British company decided to withdraw from Russia, it couldn’t take the factory with it and so it sold it to its Russian management or partners. The factory is still here, in Russia, and it still produces the same things it produced before.

☝️After 2014 events in Ukraine and first sanctions from the West Russia started the course of import substitution. Of course, it hasn’t been successful in all fields and many things could have been done better. Nonetheless, these initiatives ensured Russian food safety and turned Russia from net importer of food to net exporter. Not so long ago Russia was buying grain, meat and poultry abroad and now it is one of the largest global exporters.

➖Food inflation is the most important part of overall inflation as it directly impacts the essentials — nobody can live without food. Since Russia produces all basic food and does not import it, there is no risk of deficit and no risk of further inflation spikes above the targets established by the government.

President Erdogan called it a terrorist attack on the heart of Turkey. The suspect has already been detained and is allegedly a part of Kurdish terrorist group, some of the members of which are attempting to flee to Syria. 

➖The possible consequences of this act of terror are not clear yet. Looking at this, it is worth noting that Kurds are backed by the U.S. and the European Union and this attack will undoubtedly undermine Turkish relations with them and may even impact Turkish stance on NATO expansion and the Ukrainian conflict. 

➖As a condition for NATO membership approval, Turkey has demanded Finland and Sweden to extradite several dozens individuals that are, according to Turkey, related to Kurdish terrorist organizations or endorse those organizations. As of beginning of November, Finland and Sweden have not complied with these demands. 

➖So, if Kurdish involvement in the terrorist attack is confirmed, it is highly unlikely that Turkey will ever back down with this requirement and unless Scandinavian candidates change their position, NATO expansion will be out of question for a long period of time. Turkish society will simply not allow Erdogan any compromises on this matter.

☝️Moreover, Europe is not the main supporter of Kurdish independence movement. This “honor” goes to the United States of America, which actively supports Kurds in Syria. It is still unclear how will this tragic incident impact the relations between the U.S. and Turkey, Turkish position with regard to Ukrainian conflict and Turkish cooperation with Russia.

“We have received the message, but we will not accept and are rejecting condolences from the US embassy. We know who supports terrorism in north Syria, and we know the message they want to deliver to Türkiye through this bombing,”

🇺🇸November elections in the U.S. are already over and although it seems that Republican did win majority in Congress, it was not an overwhelming victory or expected “red wave”. The Senate breakdown is unclear and it is quite likely that Democratic party will maintain their control. How will these results impact the Ukrainian conflict?

🔷Despite some Republican slogans about ending U.S. military and financial aid to Ukraine, Russia had no high hopes about the results of the elections. Some signs indicate that Russia did favor the Republicans this time and even withheld announcement of withdrawal from Kherson city in Ukraine until the voting ended.

🔷Nonetheless, Russia knows that the majority of U.S. Republicans just as the majority of U.S. Democrats are not Russian friends and will not do anything that will look as a favor to Russia. U.S. support to Ukraine depends more on physical constraints and situation in U.S. economy than on the party controlling the House. 

🔷If any changes are expected about U.S. aid to Ukraine, those are changes about accountability. Both Republicans and Democrats are concerned about rumors of U.S.-supplied weapons ending on black market and on very high level of corruption in the AFU. 

🔷According to recent reports, the U.S. are now planning to supply Ukraine with some older stocked weaponry because they are out of reserve stock for newer models and are not able to replenish this stock quickly and provide the necessary ammunition, production ramp will take from 1 to 3 years. 

🔷That said, with Ukrainian counter-offensive soon to be stalled on the Dnieper and stabilization of the front line, further development of the situation will depend on Russian ability to disable enemy equipment. Neither Europe, nor the U.S. are willing to make their industry work solely to supply Ukraine and Ukrainian army. Ukraine’s own arms industry has very limited capacity and is mostly used to repair damaged tanks and vehicles. 

🔷This means that at some point of time foreign sponsors will no longer be able to replenish Ukraine’s losses, be it U.S. Republicans, U.S. Democrats or whoever else. The only thing Russia has to do is to outlast Ukraine and win the war of attrition and it looks like this is the tactics chosen by the Russian Ministry of Defense for this very reason.

➖Today Russian ministry of defense has announced that Russia resumes it participation in “the grain deal” upon receiving sufficient guarantees of safety. It’s worth noting that withdrawal from the grain deal was the result of outrageous terrorist attack on Russian Black Sea fleet at the port of Sevastopol that was staged under cover of the “grain corridor”.

➖Since it doesn’t look like Russia was pressured, this probably means that proposed guarantees and benefits were indeed serious. It’s worth noting that Turkey was very active in its attempts to revive the grain deal as one of its beneficiaries. Since Russian-Turkish relations are very important in light of Russian conflict with the West, it seems that President Erdogan managed to convince the Russian side to give the deal another chance.

What are the pros and cons of Russian return to the grain deal? 

➖There are several possible benefits. First of all, there must be some guarantees and benefits that aren’t yet publicized. Second, this gives a great boost to Erdogan and potentially a great profit to Turkey, which is now set to become both gas hub and grain hub for the Europe getting a serious leverage over it. While strengthening of Turkey is not directly beneficial to Russia, this makes it much likelier that Turkey will remain neutral and will keep blocking certain NATO initiatives such as adding Finland and Sweden to the alliance. 

➖There is also a humanitarian aspect of the deal. While Russia could supply some of its grain to the poorest countries and did commit to do it, the whole existence of the grain corridor did positively impact global prices on grain and reduced the risks of hunger in regions susceptible to those risks.

➖Another benefit is about guarantees given by Ukraine. To resume the deal, Ukraine provided written guarantees that it will not use the grain corridor for further terrorist attacks. Firstly, it looks like these guarantees were given not only to Russia but also to Turkey and the UN. It is quite likely that Ukraine will once again attempt terrorist attack on Russian Black Sea fleet or Crimea or that its Anglo-Saxon backers will push it to such an attack. If such thing happens, it will deal a huge blow to Ukrainian image and all Ukrainian guarantees and statements thus strengthening Russian positions. 

➖Second, the very fact of these guarantees means that Ukraine has implicitly acknowledged its responsibility for the previous attack. This guarantee is indirect proof of that, so Ukrainian image of being all nice has already suffered. Even if Ukraine tries again, Russian forces will still stay on alert so it is unlikely that Russia will suffer any serious damage because of this decision. 

➖Third, return to the grain deal nullifies the European initiative to arrange grain transportation over land routes through Moldova. Black Sea route is much less complicated, much simpler and makes sure that at least some grain gets to those who really need it and doesn’t end in Europe in its entirety. 

➖The fourth aspect is more about military situation in the Black Sea. Without grain corridor Ukraine could return to the practice of laying mines around its coast in Odessa area, which would create obstacles not only for sea transports but also for possible Russian naval operations in that area.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1782.0,3.0,2022-11-03T16:08:36+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,27.0,MessageEntityBold,834.0,66.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,402.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,402.0,,,,,MessageReplies,0.0,25478.0,False,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

✍️ Today a group of Russian bloggers have sent a request to President Vladimir Putin asking to review the decision of blocking certain social networks, specifically Instagram and Facebook (owned by Meta, prohibited in the Russian Federation, classified as an extremist organization). Similar request was sent to Dmitry Medvedev, Deputy Chairman of Russian Security Council.

☝️Bloggers pointed out that a lot of Russian people still use those social networks through VPN services and that these social networks are primarily used for entertainment purposes. They think that there is no need to waste resources on blocking if this block does not have any meaningful impact.
Oleg Matveychev, deputy head of State Duma committee on IT, information policies and communication, commented that unblocking Instagram and Facebook is out of the question. He explained that these networks aren’t created for the pleasure of bloggers and are currently being used as information weapon against the Russian Federation.

➖Kremlin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov has stated that this letter was not received yet and Kremlin has no comments on the subject so far. 

➖Should Russia indeed unblock those resources? It doesn’t look like so because they were blocked for a very good reason. The platform firmly took Ukrainian side in the present conflict and openly permitted calls for violence against Russian people. There are legal grounds for blocking these resources in Russia and as long as these grounds exist, unblocking seems unlikely.

➖So called “entertainment” in those networks is entwined with propagandist information. Those bloggers probably don’t understand that Russia is a target of massive disinformation campaign and that Russian users will immediately become targets of crooks and hackers of all sort at the very least. In fact, this block saves Russian people from manipulations and disinformation and deprives Ukraine and their Western sponsors of a powerful propaganda tool. 

➖These social networks have access to user location and users from Russia will most certainly face persecution, humiliation and attacks from mass audience of the collective West, which greatly outnumbers Russian internet audience. 

➖Some say that Russian users could help promote Russian point of view and show the real truth to the Western audience, and this point could be valid if Meta* was a truly independent and impartial platform where everyone had equal opportunities to express their views. However, as Meta* platforms are proven to be biased, impartial treatment is not guaranteed and Russian users will just get lost in the sea of hate. 

➖What Russia should really do is to extend its presence in the web and boost its own alternative social networks. While Russian language audience is more or less covered, Russia also needs an outlet to explain its points to the global audience. Despite many initiatives of the kind and certain successes, existing projects do not have global scale and have really limited capabilities on that level. The government can do a lot to support those initiatives as well as other ways to promote the Russian side in the world, but all this has to be well-thought and well-coordinated. 

➖We live in 21st century and information space is extremely important part of our world. The collective West managed to get hold of the most popular global platforms with China being second. This gives the collective West a way to influence public opinion of more than a half of global population. Russia really should not neglect this field because it often translates into real-world results.

➖Should Russia unblock Facebook? No, not while it stays the way it is. Unblocking it won’t bring benefits to the Russian cause and may create risks for the Russian people.
Instead Russia should better actively look for alternatives that would allow it to dispute Western mainstream narratives about the ongoing conflict and other relevant things.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1998.0,7.0,2022-11-02T12:15:08+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,1.0,41.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,396.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,396.0,,,,,MessageReplies,14.0,25478.0,False,[],,15587.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Message,13897,1639836943,2022-11-01T12:41:07+00:00,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"🤔 Recently, it was reported that Russia was pulling troops out of Kherson. Shortly followed by news that troops were moved into Kherson. If both are true, is Russia swapping out it's quality troops for the newly mobilized and more disposable units?

➖Those reports misinterpreted facts or were just false.
Russia did evacuate civilian population from the Western bank of Dnieper claiming that the purpose of evacuation if to protect civilians in case of possible Ukrainian assault on the city and sabotage of Kakhovskaya hydropower plant that could flood the area.

➖This evacuation is going on even now because Ukraine is indeed shelling the dam for a month already and seems that Russian military intelligence is expecting a massive strike. 

➖At the same time Russia is slowly and gradually reinforcing its defenses on Kherson front and turning Kherson city into a fortress. In fact it is doing a similar thing to what Ukraine was doing in Mariupol or Zaporozhye with an important difference that Russia does not make civilians stay there as human shields. 
However, it looks like evacuation was also a clever military trick. Ever since it was announced, Ukrainian (and Western) media started shouting about imminent recapture of Kherson by Ukrainians. They thought that Russians are planning to withdraw and abandon Kherson without a fight and probably decided that it would be an easy game to capture it. 

➖ This impacted not only media dimension - Ukraine has really brought a lot of reserves to Kherson region and made over 20 attempts to start an offensive in the last month. However, all such attempts were repealed with heavy losses for Ukraine and it looks like Russia is ready to continue defending this front for as long as it may be needed.

➖Another possible reasons for Ukrainian failure to start an offensive in Kherson include reluctance of foreign mercenary forces to go into the breach. There have been rumors that they refused to go to die and so Ukraine has to bring more and more forces from other areas. 

➖Now, if this was a trick, it was indeed a clever one because it used dominance of Ukrainian side in Western media and resulted in Western sponsors of Ukraine believing that Russians are really weak in Kherson. The sponsors kept pushing Ukraine for attack and really expected it, which is obvious from English-language media headlines from the last month that were all shouting about Russian weaknesses and imminent Ukrainian victory.

➖Since Kherson is an important position and Ukraine still has a large concentration of forces on that front, Russia is not yet rotating regular army units that are defending it. Instead, Russia is reinforcing them with newly mobilised reservists and more equipment. 
Naturally, as soon as the risk of Ukrainian assault on Kherson front gets lower, regular army units and best reservists will first get some rest and then it will be possible to use them for offensive purposes leaving the Kherson front line defended with less experienced but no less formidable forces.

➖This is not happening yet. It will most likely happen either when Ukrainians start concentrating their forces on another part of the front (and there were news that they are indeed moving reserves to a different area) or when Russia will be ready to resume offensive operations without worrying about Ukrainian army. This will most likely happen once the remaining Ukrainian fortification lines in Donbass fall.

Ukraine is running out of people ready to fight and has to draft even women as it happens in the latest wave of mobilization. Ukrainian armed forces rely more and more on mercenaries and foreign advisors but while they are always happy to kill, they are not ready and willing to die for Ukraine. Most of them stay in the rear and see this as a game where they always have a way out. 

➖The level of unrest is hard to measure, but some Ukrainian sources state that even forces on the front are not very eager to fight and are getting angry with Zelensky for his stubbornness and lack of will to admit the reality and call for peace.

➖Every day is working against Ukraine and desperate Kiev government may resort to desperate measures. There has been strong evidence that Ukrainian side is preparing a provocation involving use of a “dirty bomb”, which is a conventional bomb charged with radioactive materials. Today Russian media disclosed some details of the planned operation — Ukrainian factory produced a replica of a part of Russian Iskander missile and is planning to produce it as “proof of Russian responsibility” to global media that won’t need anything else and will gladly photoshop the missing details. 

➖Considering lack of Ukrainian military successes and overall lack of enthusiasm among both Ukrainian sponsors in the West and Ukrainian people, this provocation seems quite probable. Media sources state several potential points where it can take place, from Nikolayev and Dnipro to the restricted zone of Chernobyl nuclear plant.

The beginning of this week was marked with news about a letter from 30 Democrat Congressmen to President Biden with a request to start peace negotiations with Russia. One day later this letter was rescinded and its signatories stated that it was signed a few months ago and was published by mistake. 

❓What does it mean in the context of US politics? In fact, this letter was just a part of internal political games prior to mid-term elections. It had no practical impact but has just demonstrated the electors that some Democrats can be reasonable.

❕ Meanwhile, Biden’s administration has confirmed that they are not planning to enter negotiations with Russia without participation of Ukraine, and since Ukrainian government has ruled this option out by enacting laws prohibiting such negotiations, it seems that there will be no diplomatic solution in foreseeable future.

❓ Why is US administration acting this way? There are several versions about reasons and motives for their stubborn desire to keep pumping money into Ukrainian black hole of economy and military. 

➖It is quite possible that U.S. administration and legislators are plainly misinformed about real situation on the ground. They get their reports from intelligence services, but there is a good history of such reports being inaccurate or simply false as in case with Iraq, Syria or the story of Russian intervention in U.S. elections. 

➖It is quite possible that U.S. intelligence services are getting their information from Ukrainian Ministry of Defense or even from media. Such sources provide very different picture of the situation. In fact, mainstream U.S. and globalist media keep insisting that Ukraine is winning in the conflict and that Russian cause is doomed and desperate. 

➖Blind dismissal of all facts about sabotage acts by Ukraine fits into this narrative. If US leadership sincerely believes that Ukraine is winning, they surely see no point for Ukraine to resort to such acts as destruction of Kakhovskaya dam or detonation of a “dirty bomb”. Ukrainian reports show that U.S. support is meaningful and did turn the tide of this conflict. 

➖However, this version implies a lot of incompetence on all levels in U.S. intelligence and among U.S. legislators and administration. It is enough to look at the map to notice that last Ukrainian success happened already a month ago and was by no means decisive. Meanwhile, Russian forces are building up defenses on existing positions and preparing for further offensive while slowly pushing Ukrainian forces in Eastern part of the front. We have been hearing about imminent Ukrainian victory in Kherson region for several weeks now, but so far we have seen only a number of unsuccessful assault attempts that have all been repealed. 

➖Of course, it is possible that U.S. intelligence reports only things that U.S. administration wants to hear ignoring actual situation on the ground. However, it is much more credible that policy makers in the U.S. know exactly what is going on but use Ukrainian conflict for their own purposes. Biden’s administration has invested too much in support of Ukraine and this is likely to result in defeat of Democratic party on the coming mid-term elections. They are probably thinking that any steps back right now will cost them their supporters and may even result in investigation of their actions that are costing the U.S. quite a lot...",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1995.0,3.0,2022-10-26T08:26:03+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,73.0,MessageEntityBold,679.0,271.0,MessageEntityBold,1174.0,96.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,377.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,377.0,,,,,MessageReplies,5.0,25478.0,False,[],,13390.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

➖ Last few days saw increased talks about potential use of a dirty bomb in Ukraine. Russian Minister of Defense Sergey Shoigu has called several of his peers warning about the possible outcome. Russian Armed Forces are training to operate in the environment of increased radiation. How real is the threat? Who would be responsible for it? 

➖ The threat of “dirty bomb”, i. e. a non-nuclear bomb filled with radioactive materials that is capable of radioactive contamination of quite large area has always been looming around ever since the beginning of the Ukrainian conflict. While the government of Ukraine does not possess the technologies, qualification and facilities to produce real nuclear weapons, Ukraine has a number of nuclear power plants inherited from the USSR as well as access to Chernobyl “burial site” that also has a lot of radioactive materials. 

➖ It means that Ukraine is technologically capable to use a dirty bomb. Capabilities of Russia are not even questioned although Russia has no reasons to use dirty bombs as it has a plenty of tactical nuclear weapons that can do immense real damage and decide the conflict if used. 

❓Who would be responsible for it? Well, we have to see, which side will gain profit and advantage of such a provocation. We can surely be confident of one thing, no matter what happens, Ukraine will accuse Russia of it. 
What would be the impact of a dirty bomb? Detonation of a such a bomb would result in radioactive contamination of a large area with exact numbers depending on winds, rains and other weather conditions. 

➖ Direct damage caused by such a bomb is minimal, it may impact only people or objects in its direct vicinity. Indirect damage takes a form of radioactive contamination, which may render area uninhabitable for years, decades or even centuries depending on charge of the bomb and radiation levels. Damage to inhabitants of the area depends on their closeness to explosion site and the level of their exposure to radiation. In either case, they have very high chance of surviving and avoiding permanent damage if they are not located in close vicinity of the bomb and are promptly evacuated. 

➖ Despite certain accusations coming from Ukraine, it is hard to imagine any possible Russian benefits from getting involved in such an act. It will not cause any damage to Ukrainian troops. Using it at the front lines running inside regions that have recently joined Russia does not look reasonable and is very likely to cause damage to Russian forces as well. Using it against Ukrainian cities will not bring any advantages. Especially against cities like Nikolaev or Odessa that still have a good number of pro-Russian people in the underground. 

➖ Ukraine could scream that it is an attempt to frame them, but honestly speaking Russia does not need to frame Ukraine and has no chances of doing so considering massive support of Ukraine by globalist media. 

➖ So what is the possible benefit for Russia? Use it as an excuse for something? Like what? Russia does not need any more excuses to do whatever it deems necessary with regards to Ukrainian operation. However, Russia is deeply worried about it happening and that is the reason for unprecedented wave of calls from Russian Ministry of Defense to its NATO counterparts...",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,4866.0,18.0,2022-10-25T08:44:34+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,42.0,MessageEntityBold,1620.0,48.0,MessageEntityBold,2263.0,90.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,374.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,374.0,,,,,MessageReplies,3.0,25478.0,False,[],,13294.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Is it possible? What about WTO rules?

❓Sue where? In US court? In US-controlled international court? Since there is no independent and impartial forum, this legislation won’t result in anything meaningful. It will be just same usual US approach, applying their own legislation and jurisdiction over the entire world.

🔷It all boils down to usual threats and pressure on OPEC nations to make them act in US interests instead of their own interests. OPEC is quite a loose organization and US has influence over many of its members. Yes, Biden managed to spoil US relations with Saudi Arabia, but the U.S. still can push the Arab countries hard.

🔷Even a threat of sanctions like those applied to Russia will make them do whatever U.S. says. Especially considering the fact that most OPEC billionaires store their wealth in the West.
Anti-Russian sanctions made the whole third world worry about their capitals and investments in the Western world. That created a very bad precedent and they just can’t be sure that such sanctions won’t be applied to them. For example, tomorrow US might “notice” that there is a war going on in Yemen, accuse Saudi Arabia of aggression and impose all imaginable sanctions against it. As for the issue of “human rights”, no country can be safe from accusations here.

🔷Now we come to WTO. In case with Russia, sanctions aren’t compliant with WTO rules or rather WTO objective to “open the markets and ensure stable, safe, transparent and predictable trade relations”.

🔷Russia had strong opposition to WTO because its rules were detrimental for restoration of national industry and reduced its competitiveness on the global market. Yet, Russia still formally remains a WTO member althought it’s now a liability, not a benefit and it seems that WTO rules are ignored when applied to Russia.

🔷This was true about all sanctions that were placed on Russia ever since December 2012 (and Russia entered WTO only in August 2012 after many years of negotiations and national legislation reforms).

🔷Yes, article 21 of WTO charter provides WTO members the right to implement sanctions “in the interests of national security”, but this article is too broad and doesn’t provide any specific scope of those “interests”. For example, it’s hard to see how any Russian actions in Europe impact US national security interests (in traditional sense). They could be perceived as impacting national security interests of EU countries, but it’s still too loose.
While it maybe can be applied to 2022 sanctions, it wasn’t applicable to 2012 sanctions, 2014 sanctions and all other sanction packages up to February 2022. 

🔷To sum it up, yes, US can introduce any laws and try to enforce compliance with those laws. They will probably find a weak point and some OPEC members will back off and do whatever US says. However, this won’t make US actions legal. 

🔷Yes, there are antitrust rules and laws, but they can be applied only in relevant jurisdictions. Laws of the United States have no jurisdiction over the entire world and the very idea of price control by the buyer is alien to the concept of free market.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2767.0,12.0,2022-10-24T17:43:06+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,223.0,MessageEntityItalic,2575.0,10.0,MessageEntityItalic,2678.0,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,372.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,372.0,,,,,MessageReplies,3.0,25478.0,False,[],,13249.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is always a chance but it will not be easy for those countries. 

🔷 One should not forget that sanctions are not unilateral. Russia has also implemented sanctions against Western countries. Countries that have imposed sanctions upon Russia are now considered unfriendly countries and trade with these countries is restricted. If some country would like to go back to trading with Russia, this country has to withdraw its own sanctions and negotiate removal from the list with Russia. 

🔷 Such scenario looks unlikely now and implies that this hypothetical country goes against overall policy of the Western bloc. When the Ukrainian crisis is over, chances will get better. However, everything will depend on the policy of the United States of America and their own desire to maintain sanctions and trade with Russia. 

🔷 The volume of trade between US and Russia has always been low as compared to their trade with other countries. Russia is not even in top 20 of main US trade partners. EU was the main trade partner of the Russian Federation with China holding a firm second place. However, if we speak about individual countries and not about EU, China has no competitors here.

🔷 Top three Russian trade partners in 2021 were China (17.9%), Germany (7.3%) and Netherlands (5.9%). Looking at their own statistics, we can see that Russia is not that important for China (2.1% of Chinese export), while US is as important as China is for Russia (17.1% of Chinese export goes to US). Export to Russia is not relevant for Germany, Russia is not even in top ten of German export destinations. The same is true about Netherlands.

🔷 Looking at those statistics it seems unlikely that any Western country has really serious incentives to go back to trading with Russia. However, statistics is one thing and reality in the other thing. Looking at the statistics, it would be impossible to predict the devastating impact of anti-Russian sanctions on European economies. 

🔷 Why was that impact so noticeable? Because import-export flows are a complicated thing and Russia and Europe did have strong economical ties and were interdependent. 

🔷 Import-export statistics does not account for subsidiaries of foreign companies that operated in Russia and have now withdrawn from the country leaving behind their production facilities. Import-export statistics does not account for dependence of European industry on cheap Russian energy, which was the main factor that made it competitive. Termination of cheap energy supplies increased production costs and caused a chain reaction that hasn’t yet manifested in full. 

🔷 Although Europe is able to get energy from alternative sources, there is one big factor that makes it irrelevant — this energy is not cheap. Increased energy costs result in increased production costs, which manifest in inflation, devaluation of currency and further increase of energy costs. Industries become less competitive and are forced to reduce production. This results in loss of jobs and increased unemployment, which creates another burden for state budgets…",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,2876.0,6.0,2022-10-24T15:28:05+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,87.0,MessageEntityBold,419.0,164.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,369.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,369.0,,,,,MessageReplies,2.0,25478.0,False,[],,14079.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Russian economy has survived the initial shock without huge problems or a big crisis. Smart measures of the government taken in spring stopped the initial panic and helped to restore economical order. 

▪️The secondary shock (end of stocks for short life imported products and components) should be coming now but the government had time to prepare, so it’s likely that it won’t be happening. Import substitution seems to have worked, at least in consumer sector. 

▪️The tertiary shock (end of stocks for long life imported products and component) could have the most serious impact. However, it looks like import substitution works here as well. The more time passes, the easier it gets for Russia. 

🔺Sanctions did hurt consumer economy. Popular brands are gone and new brands are fighting for the market. I guess premium sector has suffered most of all, it’s not like most Russians care about brands when they buy things like everyday clothing or textiles. 

They were cautious about Chinese household equipment and electronics, but with time it is clear that it is virtually the same as “big brands”, just cheaper because consumers don’t have to cover marketing expenses of the manufacturer. 

🔺Sanctions did hurt industries. Many factories had to readjust supply chains, look for new suppliers, search for new logistical routes. The process of adaptation is mostly over. 

The West is also doing fine without Russian gas. They buy LNG, they look for alternative sources. Rising prices and high inflation are just temporary, and of course European governments will regulate prices so that Europeans won’t find themselves paying half of their income just for utilities and leaving the other half in grocery stores. 

Everything will be fine.

— Well, it looks quite reasonable to withdraw committment into a conflict world away, focus on internal development and profit on trade with the parties involved in this conflict. 

I think it’s more about choosing an enemy for the US. The US needs a global enemy to justify its defense industry, huge army and presence all around the globe. And I think that those Republicans think that Russia is not such an enemy. 

Russia is fighting “economical war” with the West right now, a war that has been forced on it. While termination of Russian trade had a serious impact on Europe, the United States didn’t suffer from it. The United States get additional bonuses from economical weakness of Europe, as it becomes a large market for US products and services while European capitals flee to the safety of US federal bonds and securities.

Is the Russian central bank struggling to tame the ruble? It was great when it rebounded to pre-war levels but now it's too powerful for its own good at 58 rubles a dollar. I have read that they are failing to keep it under check. How true is this?

Soon after the beginning of special operation USD rate has skyrocketed and reached about 150 rubles per dollar on the fears of recession and hyperinflation in Russia. However, this situation didn’t last long although it did bring some hyper-profits to Russian exporters.

Russian government and Russian Central Bank did incredible job since April to stabilize the situation and they actually managed to stabilize the economy and prevent crisis by summer. They implemented harsh currency control measures to prevent currency speculations, and this worked surprisingly well. The thing is that real purchasing value of Russian ruble has always been much higher than its rate and without speculators it went closer to its fair value. 

Another thing that impacted the rate of ruble was reduction of import and expansion of import substitution initiatives. Russian exporters kept selling their products and they had to sell currency on the market. However, Russian importers didn’t buy that currency because import flow was seriously disrupted. This resulted in low demand for USD and its rate normalized. 

During summer the Russian government has gradually lifted all currency restrictions except the restriction for trade of physical currency (paper). The latter restriction stays because Western countries stopped exporting bank notes to Russia so supply is limited. Otherwise, there are no restrictions on currency exchange and bank transfers of foreign currency. Nonetheless, reduced import level still impacts demand and USD (and other foreign currencies) keep having low rate. 

This is neither good nor bad. With reduced import volumes Russia doesn’t need too much foreign currency, however it does create some opportunities for those entrepreneurs who are still willing to import something despite all logistical complexities. They are making new business ties in South Asia and East Asia and setting up new logistical routes. Not everything is working perfectly for now, but if there are no big changes, in a year or two Russia will have completely new import structure that will bypass the West. 

Does Russia need high USD rate? Does Russia need low USD rate? The reality is that for USD rate doesn’t matter at all for internal Russian needs. It is relevant in dollar-based economy, where national currency emission is tied to USD. Russia is moving away from this type of economy, so eventually USD rate will matter only for import-export operations. Long-term plans of switching foreign trade to rubles and national currencies of Russian trade partners may eventually make USD entirely irrelevant.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,3535.0,7.0,2022-09-28T10:31:21+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityHashtag,0.0,10.0,MessageEntityBold,834.0,158.0,MessageEntityBold,1512.0,116.0,MessageEntityBold,1844.0,30.0,MessageEntityBold,2193.0,172.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,288.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,288.0,,,,,MessageReplies,5.0,25478.0,False,[],,8833.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Could mobilization provoke widespread anger at Putin while offering little short-term help on the battlefield? There is no simple way to train, equip and find officers for a vast new army. The process would probably take more than a year?

- Highly unlikely. Firstly, during all the opinion polls conducted in Russia including those of made by western or western backed sociologists, the result has been that Russian overwhelmingly support both Putin and the war effort. Statista reports that in August 2022, so about a month ago, 80% of Russians supported the war. 

Recent events might have changed this slightly, but a military defeat in the field doesn’t make people abandon the war effort, it usually makes them more angry and determined to fight on. England didn’t give up in WW2, because they lost France, on the contrary it made them get serious.

As for offering little help, increasing the formations of the army to full strength is not going to do nothing. Again, do you really think Russia would spent billions on a joke? Massive logistical and economic strain is not something you do because it has no impact.

In my estimation, the full impact of the mobilization will not be felt for some time, possibly several months, for various reasons. But have no doubt, it will have some impact. Will it mean a drastic reversal for Ukraine? Maybe not, but once it is fully deployed, it is quite likely you’ll notice.

As for your premise there is no simple way to train equip and find officers for a vast army, you are wrong. That is the point of reservists. When an officer leaves the army, they become part of the officer reserve. And Russia had an excess of officers in the past. They don’t need to train officers, these guys are already trained. 

Maybe they will need a refresher course, however that will not take long. As for equipment, the Russian arsenals were made for supplying an army of up to 4 million in war time. Supplying 300,000 will probably not be a problem. You are somehow thinking that reservists are new recruits. This is not the case.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,3816.0,9.0,2022-09-27T16:11:53+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,39.0,MessageEntityItalic,39.0,240.0,MessageEntityBold,895.0,112.0,MessageEntityBold,2023.0,80.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,280.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,280.0,,,,,MessageReplies,9.0,25478.0,False,[],,9293.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
