One of the main demands of Euromaidan protesters to the new government was to launch a comprehensive person- nel reform that would cleanse the state apparatus from public officials of the Commu- nist era (1919‚Äì1991) and those affiliated with the Yanukovych regime (2010‚Äì2014). This article examines the lustration process in post-Euromaidan Ukraine through the prism of earlier personnel reforms, mainly in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), and discusses the similarities and differences between them. The analysis focuses on two key features that make the Ukrainian case stand out across CEE lustrations. First, Ukraine‚Äôs lustration reconciled transitional justice with socio-economic imperatives, such as the fight against corruption, not only as a discursive practice but also a legal matter. Second, unlike CEE lustrations the Ukrainian government implemented lustration 23 years after the fall of Communism and during the ongoing military confrontation in eastern Ukrainian Donetsk and Luhansk regions (Donbas). The article contributes to the literature on the evolution of transitional justice which has expanded far beyond the conventional redress for past human rights violations and may now incorporate peacebuilding and structural justice agendas.

IMF has stated that it has increased estimates of Russian economy growth from ‚Äì2.3% contraction to 0.3% growth in 2023 despite a broad array of Western sanctions.

The IMF attributes this improvement to Russia finding new clients outside the West by redirecting trade from sanctioning to non-sanctioning countries. Activity of Russian defense industrial complex was one of the main contributors for projected growth.

These are good news, as we know that Western forecasts never favor Russia. Last year they forecasted collapse of Russian economy, then they stated that it will not return to growth until second half of 2020s, then it was 2024 and now it has already happened.

It looks like IMF reluctantly acknowledged amazingly quick recovery of Russian economy to add credibility to its other forecasts, such as the one concerning Europe. Yes, you heard it right, they forecast that European economy will grow in 2023. Despite it having far deeper problems than Russia. 

The thing is that Russia had to find customers for its export products, which are in very high demand. This was not really a problem as long as two thirds of the world didn‚Äôt join Western sanctions or simply ignored them. 

European problem is different, they need to find resources, especially energy. Amid looming energy crisis and soaring prices that are expected to come this year when Chinese reopening gains momentum, their chances to get a good deal are slim. 

For now, Europe is still living on Russian resources, despite all of their nice words. They are getting them from intermediary countries while some are coming directly from Russia. There is physically no way to replace Russian supplies and maintain European industry competitive, so all growth forecasts are likely to be artificial. 

There is a fundamental flaw in IMF estimations of economic growth. They estimate this growth in US dollars, and it is no longer a stable currency as it once used to be. 

Moreover, the rate of USD and EUR is greatly inflated and as these currencies are slowly but steadily losing relevance for international trade, estimates in these currencies are no longer objective. More objective are estimations based on purchasing power of currency and not on its market rate to USD. 

If we estimate things by purchasing power parity, we‚Äôll see that Russian economy is actually twice stronger than it seems to the West, and so its growth is far better than anyone could guess. For reference, while market exchange rate is around $1 = 70 rubles, purchasing power rate is under 30 rubles per dollar.

Fortunately for Russia, dollar rate has little impact on its economy and influences only foreign trade. As Russia is readjusting its import-export flows, higher dollar rate means that Russia earns more money through export and can afford to import more goods, which translates into lower consumer prices. 

A fun fact, prices on modern notebooks in Russia fell by 25 percent since last October due to competition of parallel import and Chinese manufacturers trying to enter the lucrative Russian market. So, Russia is fine.

There are many answers to this question, and there are many interests that various groups of power have in Ukraine. One of these groups of power is U.S. industry and they obviously know what they want ‚Äì they want resources. 

Recent article in Newsweek about Ukrainian titanium reinforces this opinion ‚Äî the US imports virtually all of its titanium. Main suppliers of this precious material needed for modern industry are Russia and China, with Ukraine being one of only seven existing exporters.

Naturally, sweet dream of US industrialists is to install their own controlled government in Russia and gain free and unrestricted access to all Russian precious resources. Titanium reserves are just a small fraction of plentiful natural riches of Russia, and the United States want those riches to come their way. 

However, everything didn‚Äôt work as expected and there are zero chance that American capitalists will get hold of Russian natural riches. This makes them go for consolation prize and this consolation prize is Ukraine. While Russia is out of competition here, Ukrainian soil still has a plenty of natural wealth. Titanium, uranium, lithium and numerous other metals. 

Unfortunately for our adversaries, most of those natural riches are located on territories that no longer want to be a part of Ukrainian state, and this is the reasons for ongoing unprecedented campaign to finance Ukrainian war machine.

Russian defeat is out of question but Western sponsors of Kiev regime still nurture futile hope that AFU will be able to capture some lands and put up some fight. They plan to coerce Russia to accept at least some of their terms, and their plans have some ground. 

Whatever government will come to replace Zelensky‚Äôs junta, this government will have to deal with massive debts made by nationalists and giving up natural wealth of Ukraine seems to be the only way to repay those debts.

Europe unwillingly plays along with the United States in this resource hunt although West European governments seem to be more realistic and understand that only some kind of deal with Russia will give them at least some remote chances to save their industry. 

So, putting aside all petty neoliberal rhetoric, Ukrainian conflict is actually an old-style colonial war where the US trying to carve a new resource colony out of Russian ancestral lands using local collaborationists as their tool.

Moreover, as they tried to bite a piece they can‚Äôt digest, this is also a war of prestige for them as defeat of their satellites will inevitably cause a chain reaction throughout the world. 

Still, no matter what, the ultimate outcome depends entirely on Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and political will of Russian government. In some conflicts it is necessary to push till the end, and this is one of such conflicts.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,5276.0,30.0,2023-02-06T08:38:45+00:00,,,[],,MessageMediaWebPage,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,1.0,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,0.0,1.0,MessageEntityBold,1.0,44.0,MessageEntityBold,248.0,19.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,278.0,7.0,MessageEntityBold,554.0,302.0,MessageEntityBold,2263.0,182.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,566.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,566.0,,,,,MessageReplies,13.0,25478.0,False,[],,17923.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WebPage,5.101944046571774e+18,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to Bloomberg, IMF is currently considering another $16 billion aid package for Ukraine.

The Fund's program will require fulfillment of a number of conditions, and the first disbursement may come as early as April.

Ukraine is already the third highest borrower of the IMF. Its debt has been mounting higher and higher for years, and in a few months after Russian SMO started the country got technically bankrupt. Ukraine‚Äôs creditors have suspended repayment until the end of this year, or else the country would have been unable to meet its obligations.

Maybe na√Øve Ukrainians keep thinking that someone will write off or cover their debts, but it is too much of wishful thinking. Money drives the West, and they are not a charity to give this money for free. So yes, future generations of Ukrainians will still pay. 

Meanwhile, the current government is enjoying its feast in the time of plague and is asking for more and more tools of war and money to pay its current bills. When a country cannot service its debt, it becomes dependent on its creditors, and Kiev regime turned Ukrainians into eternal serfs of the West.

One could compare Ukrainian elites with gamblers who have already lost everything and are now going deep in debts in desperate attempts to win something. While they really look this way, they are not so stupid. 

Zelensky and his team are just trying to drain as much money as they can from ‚ÄúProject Ukraine‚Äù to enjoy safe and comfortable retirement somewhere in Miami together with other former leaders of Maidan. 

Despite Zelensky playing role of a hero president, neither he nor anyone else can save Ukraine from military defeat and complete bankruptcy. It‚Äôs highly likely that Ukrainian government will completely change when Russia ends its special military operation, and it‚Äôs also highly likely that new Ukrainian government will face very hard choices with regard to debts made by Zelensky & Co. 

I don‚Äôt think that there is anyone left in Ukraine who believes fairly tales about EU entry ‚Äúin just a couple years‚Äù, huge EU subsidies and life without poverty. Europe has its own problems and it‚Äôs more likely that in a couple years many Europeans will live like Ukrainians and not vice versa. 

So, this hypothetic future Ukrainian government will have only one way out of debt ‚Äî pay it with assets, and land is the only liquid asset Ukraine has. West Ukraine will probably be enough, so this part of Ukraine will surely get to EU as a part of Poland‚Ä¶ or maybe even Germany, who knows how things will change after a few more AFU defeats.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,4343.0,9.0,2023-02-02T13:02:18+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,2.0,49.0,MessageEntityItalic,114.0,11.0,MessageEntityBold,279.0,196.0,MessageEntityBold,825.0,55.0,MessageEntityBold,1747.0,245.0,MessageEntityBold,2302.0,141.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,565.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,565.0,,,,,MessageReplies,23.0,25478.0,False,[],,18051.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The siege of Leningrad commenced on 8 September 1941. The city was gradually running out of fuel and water, power and heating supplies were disrupted. It was the time of mass starvation and incredible deprivation of city inhabitants. Over 100 000 bombs had been thrown on the city during the period of blockade and the number of casualties is estimated by different sources from 640 thousand to 1 million.

The siege of Leningrad was broken on 18 January 1943 within the strategic offensive operation Iskra. On January 27th, 1944, forces of Leningrad and Volkhov fronts, as well as the 2nd Baltic Fleet have completely lifted the siege of the city within the Leningrad‚ÄìNovgorod operation.

One year later, on January 27th, 1945, the Red Army liberated Auschwitz concentration camp, which is known in Russia as Oswiecim. It was the largest of the German Nazi concentration camps and extermination centers. Over 1.1 million men, women and children have lost their lives here.

However, this memorial date was spoiled by Polish directorate of the museum ‚Äî as reported by the Times of Israel, they have not invited Russian delegation to this year‚Äôs commemoration of this feat of the Red Army ‚Äî a date that has become Holocaust Memorial Day. 

Until now, Russia has always taken part in the commemoration held every year on January 27, with its delegate speaking at the main ceremony. Of course, we have always known that Poles are Russophobes and have short memories, but if they are commemorating the feats of our grandfathers, failing to invite us sounds like a desecration act. 

Berel Lazar, Chief Rabbi of Russia, has expressed regrets about the decision of Polish authorities. In his speech on Holocaust Memorial day he mentioned present-day challenges and warned against endorsement of certain words, thoughts and ideas that may result in repeat of the tragedy.

Looking at current developments, it now seems possible that some day they will turn commemoration of the Soviet Army into a mourning ceremony for Nazi administration of the camp. Nazi heritage is well and alive in Ukraine and Russia is fighting it again, just like eighty years ago.

Polish people should better rethink their history. Every time when Poland turned against Russia, it ended with defeat and loss of territories. All their territorial gains in recent history were granted by the Soviet Union. Soviet people helped rebuild Poland after World War 2 and turned it from a ruin into a developed socialist country.

Rasmus Paludan, leader of Danish far right movement Stram Kurs, threatened Erdogan with new performances like public burning of Quran last week and demanding change of Turkish stance on NATO membership for Sweden and Finland. 

In recent years far right parties have gained some momentum in Scandinavia, most notably in Sweden. 

Paludan‚Äôs movement does not enjoy popularity at home and that is the reason why he chose neighboring Sweden for his performances ‚Äî Stockholm has more loyal audience. Populist right party ‚ÄúSwedish Democrats‚Äù is a part of the ruling coalition of Sweden and a large part of its members have strong anti-Muslim views. Sweden is becoming an arena of increasing ethnic and religious tensions, which resulted in increase of crime by 71 percent in last three years.

These acts infuriate all Muslims around the world, including Swedish Muslims that constitute almost 10 percent of population. While moderate Islam simply condemns such acts and revises its affiliations, radical Islamists may get engaged in some activity Sweden and the entire European Union. Offending religious feelings of 44 million Muslims living in European countries creates the environment for potential terrorist attacks.

What does it mean for Russia? We can view it as an unexpected gift. Outrage at Europe will bring the Arab world closer to Russian camp. Unlike Europeans, Russia does respect Muslim values and its considerable Muslim population enjoys full rights and respect in the society.

Turkey has already expressed its outrage about these performances and if someone thinks that desecration of Muslim holy book will push Erdogan to concessions, this someone is extremely wrong. 

Naturally, accepting the application of Sweden and its peer Finland to join NATO is now off the table. If Erdogan does win the coming elections in spring, Turkey may take further steps to distance from Europe and Ukraine. Some Turkish parliament members are even talking about Turkey‚Äôs exit from NATO, which will be a huge blow to the alliance as Turkey has the second strongest army after the United States.

Turkish-Russian relations are quite good. We are not friends, we have conflicting interests in several regions, but we have quite strong business and interpersonal ties. Turkey became the most important logistical hub for the remaining trade between Russia and Europe.

Russian diplomats have already succeeded in promoting reconciliation between Turkey and Syria and if things go as they are, chances for Erdogan‚Äôs meeting with Assad will increase. This will bring the end of Syrian conflict even closer and will be a clear diplomatic victory for Russia. 

Bringing Turkey to the Russian camp would mean a really big blow for NATO and acts of European radicals are turning it from something unimaginable into a realistic prospect.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,3329.0,7.0,2023-01-30T17:31:48+00:00,,,[],,MessageMediaWebPage,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,0.0,2.0,MessageEntityBold,3.0,91.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,158.0,18.0,MessageEntityBold,883.0,124.0,MessageEntityBold,2462.0,284.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,562.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,562.0,,,,,MessageReplies,9.0,25478.0,False,[],,17850.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WebPage,3.184140501642497e+18,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As Annalena Berbock said, the West is fighting a war with Russia and its self-restrictions are gradually disappearing.

One of those self-restrictions was related to supply of combat aircraft. The United States have said many times that they are not going to supply aircraft to Ukraine, but they said the same about tanks and Patriots, so their words cannot really be trusted.

Whatever the West gives Zelensky, he keeps begging for more. He got artillery, he asks for ammunition, he got ammunition, he asks for air defense, he got air defense, he asks for tanks, he got tanks, he asks for airplanes, and so on, and so on.

So, now Ukraine is asking for aircraft. For some reason, they think that F-16s will save them where everything else failed. As it stands now, the US government is not going to supply this aircraft to Ukraine officially. However, supplies through ‚Äúpartners‚Äù are quite possible. 

Lockheed Martin corporation that produces F-16s has said that it ‚Äústands ready to meet demand for its F-16 aircraft as some of Ukraine‚Äôs closest European allies revive efforts to provide fighter jets to Kyiv‚Äù. 

F-16 has been developed in 1974 and its operation started in 1978. Over 4,600 aircraft have been built since production was approved in 1976. They are no longer being purchased by the U.S. Air Force, but improved versions are being built for export customers.

As it stands now, F-16s are used by air forces of 26 countries. While most of them are unlikely to get involved in this transfer, there are 9 countries that theoretically can supply their F-16s to Ukraine to be replenished by Americans. 

Belgium (44), Denmark (77), Netherlands (60), Poland (48), Portugal (27) and Romania (17). Romania has ordered another 32 surplus jets from Norway in November 2022, and they are expected to be supplied by the end of 2023.

While Turkey (243) and Israel (362) are technically part of the Western camp, they have been very cautious in supplying Ukraine with weapons and are trying to maintain their relations with Russia, so they can be dismissed.

Greece (170) is unlikely to give up its F-16s at the moment. Military aid to Ukraine is quite unpopular in the country that will have elections this year. 

This leaves 273 F-16 fighter jets in European countries. How much can they spare? Even all of them won‚Äôt turn the tide. Ukraine has already lost 376 aircraft and F-16s is not better than Soviet or Slovak MIG-29 that were destroyed in dozens.

Russia has clear air superiority in Ukraine and even all those fighter jets won‚Äôt change this. Especially since Ukrainian pilots are not trained in flying them. Full air dominance will be achieved upon suppression of last Ukrainian air defense batteries that is expected in not-so-distant future. 

Meanwhile Ukraine uses its quickly depleting manpower reserves to hold the front and has not yet captured a single city or town with battle. Without Western military aid Ukraine would have collapsed back in summer of 2022. 

All military aid received by Kiev regime from the West just extends its agony. Of course, a very good part of Western supplies ends up on worlds black market of weapons and that is probably the main reason why certain forces keep lobbying it. Will they raise the stakes? Will we see terrorists flying F-16?

On Tuesday German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock spoke to Parliament Assembly of the Council of Europe and called to increase the volumes of military aid to Ukraine. She requested other European countries to increase their contribution of howitzers, ammunition and everything else. In conclusion of her speech she said: ‚ÄúWe are fighting a war with Russia, not with each other‚Äù. 

Effectively this means that top ranked German diplomat has publicly acknowledged that Germany considers itself in the state of war with the Russian Federation. Moreover, the entire European Union is in the state of war with the Russian Federation.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova noted that it‚Äôs not the first time when European politicians are confirming that they are ‚Äúfighting a war with Russia‚Äù instead of promoting peace on Ukraine.

Statement of the German minister goes in line with continuous escalation of Ukrainian conflict by the West. It was not a blunder, maybe it was a figure of speech but it was not a mistake. This is how Ukrainian conflict viewed in the West.

Russia knows it, Russia says it out loud, Russia tries to make it public so that the global community knows about it. Russia is playing diplomatic games. Russia is engaging in economic war with those countries.

They are escalating their involvement one step at a time, they do it very cautiously, they try to avoid public outrage and even revolutions. They barely manage to convince their people of the need to suffer high energy costs, the number of protests in Europe is unseen in modern history. 

Maybe it is time for Russia to speak with these countries from position of strength? Maybe it‚Äôs time for more harsh diplomacy? Russia is trying to maintain lighter stance and avoid escalation, Russia doesn‚Äôt want war, but our Western adversaries think otherwise. They view Russian reluctance to escalate not as desire for peace but plainly as weakness.  

Should Russia keep courting them in international diplomacy? It doesn‚Äôt look like they are ready to talk or willing to listen. They are openly sending heavy weapons to Russian enemies, weapons that will be used on Russian territories to kill Russian people. 

Of course, Europeans are pushed by the United States. However, they can be pushed only so far. What if Russia demands European countries to cease all military supplies to Ukraine and all military cooperation with Ukraine? 

What if Russia officially demands explanations from Germany about words of its foreign minister? What if Russia kicks German ambassador out of Moscow? German tanks are coming to Russian lands like 80 years ago, German top government officials says that Germany is in war with Russia.

The morale of Ukrainian military forces is getting lower and lower with more and more cases of units refusing to move on position or surrendering. The flow of volunteers is long over and AFU now uses methods of force mobilization to replenish its immense losses on Donbass front. However, not all Ukrainians are willing to die for the sake of Zelensky regime. 

Shortage of manpower and motivated nationalist forces Kiev to use controversial methods and forcefully conscript anyone even remotely fit for military service. There are even talks of force mobilization of Ukrainian migrants in Europe. 

This is understandable as Ukrainian decision to stick and hold its positions in Artemovsk and Soledar has already cost AFU tens thousands of lives. At such rate Ukraine not only has problems with offensive that its Western patrons keep demanding. Kiev has serious problems with defending the front.

Shortage of weapons and ammunition is one cause of this problem, and while for now Western supplies can still last Ukraine for a month or two, the real problems will manifest in spring. 

No Western aid can prevent these problems, even if NATO sends all their stocks of ammunition and equipment. Weapons is one thing but manpower is also important and at the current rate of losses AFU doesn‚Äôt have chances to last until summer. 

Mass desertion of AFU soldiers resulted in increased number of foreign mercenaries at the combat zone but those foreign mercenaries usually avoid combat directly. Russian forces don‚Äôt spare these mercenaries and their losses are also counted in thousands. While a year ago Western media estimated the number of mercenaries around 20-30 thousand, by now their number has drastically reduced. Many were killed, many decided that it‚Äôs not their war. 

Increased punishments were already a thing on Ukrainian side with blocking detachments and murders without trial. This decree signed by Zelensky only formalizes this practice and has the purpose to scare the hell out of force mobilized civilians so that they wouldn‚Äôt even think of surrendering or running away.

It is likely that we will see further toughening of penalties in future, as AFU morale keeps going down and denazification successfully reduces the number of die-hard nationalists despite their attempts to hide behind the backs of cannon fodder.

However, this is unlikely to boost Ukrainian morale. It is an act of desperation, not something that will change the situation. Moreover, increased punishments are likely to have the opposite effect with more units and individual soldiers surrendering and switching sides. The story of losses in Soledar and Artemovsk have opened the eyes of many Ukrainians about attitude of their government to lives of their citizens.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,16427.0,88.0,2023-01-27T10:41:39+00:00,,,[],,MessageMediaWebPage,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,0.0,2.0,MessageEntityBold,2.0,22.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,24.0,6.0,MessageEntityBold,30.0,54.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,185.0,8.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,217.0,12.0,MessageEntityBold,231.0,131.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,373.0,37.0,MessageEntityBold,446.0,92.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,538.0,20.0,MessageEntityBold,538.0,20.0,MessageEntityBold,558.0,122.0,MessageEntityBold,984.0,184.0,MessageEntityBold,1415.0,5.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,1420.0,25.0,MessageEntityBold,1420.0,25.0,MessageEntityBold,1445.0,110.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,1555.0,12.0,MessageEntityBold,1555.0,12.0,MessageEntityBold,1567.0,9.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,1797.0,7.0,MessageEntityBold,1864.0,65.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,1930.0,20.0,MessageEntityBold,1951.0,3.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,1955.0,21.0,MessageEntityBold,2477.0,73.0,MessageEntityBold,2552.0,143.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,2720.0,7.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,2732.0,9.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,558.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,558.0,,,,,MessageReplies,6.0,25478.0,False,[],,17648.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WebPage,3.1841405017160146e+18,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Message,17568,1639836943,2023-01-25T11:37:51+00:00,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"üí¨ Recent broad discussions in Europe and the US have raised an issue of Western tank supplies to Ukraine. 

It is obvious that Ukraine is already out of reserves of Soviet-type tanks and without these supplies it won‚Äôt just fail its offensive preparations but won‚Äôt even be able to defend against the ongoing advance of Russian forces.

However these Western tanks won‚Äôt help Ukraine much. US General Mark Hertling (ret.) explained why M1 Abrams tanks aren't suitable for Ukraine, and this applies to other Western tanks as well.

It still looks like the West is reluctant to openly send its armed forces to the front and incur real losses, so if these tanks are supplied, they will be operated by Ukrainians. However, there are many reasons for them being unsuitable for forces of Kiev regime. 

Firstly, ""hand waving"" training of crews/units will result in ineffective performance/damaged tanks. Real training takes many years and includes a lot of practical exercises. Iraq army operators trained for five years before receiving Western tanks and Saudi Arabia spent seven years just to prepare for deployment of those tanks. Obviously, AFU doesn‚Äôt have that time.

Moreover, the Abrams tanks require extensive firing training. Without proper training it will be as good as useless.

Secondly, tank drivers also need thorough training. Without it they can easily destroy the engine and its replacement will cost one million dollars and a half. 

Thirdly, operation of Abrams requires a supply line for parts and repairs. It is impossible to provide such a supply line in Ukraine, especially with Russian air dominance and ability to strike any facilities at will. 

Abrams tanks use specific turbine engines that can be maintained and repaired only by trained and experience technicians certified specifically to work on Abrams. Ukraine has no such specialists and it‚Äôs unlikely that the U.S. will provide its own technicians for this purpose.

Ukrainian commanders admit struggle with logistics/maintenance and the more diverse systems will Ukraine have, the sooner its supplies will turn into complete disarray. Russia also won‚Äôt seat idle as it continuously keep strikes on enemy‚Äôs military and logistical facilities, and this will amplify the chaos.

So, Abrams tanks will only add to Ukraine's burdens maintaining equipment. Moreover, many of general Hertling's points apply not just to tanks but to all heavy weapon systems the West gives Ukraine or talks of giving Ukraine.

Ukrainian migrants started working in Europe en masse long before the special military operation. Economical skills of post-2014 Ukrainian government made it impossible for too many people to work and live a normal life in Ukraine, so millions of Ukrainians went to work abroad. East Ukrainians mostly favored Russia and millions of them are still here, while West Ukrainians preferred Europe. 

Naturally, many of them just wanted to live on subsidies but in reality Europeans just turned them into cheap workforce. Poland was the country that had a lot of these modern serfs that worked for scraps as they had no option to survive at home.

However, when Russia started its special military operation, more Ukrainians rushed across the border to flee the conflict and hoping for better life and excellent treatment. Immense wave of so-called refugees have overwhelmed both Western and Eastern Europe. 

For a few months European governments did subsidize them and helped them with housing, but by autumn it became clear that Ukrainians are just a burden, not a boost. Social benefit system became overstrained and as locals began to suffer, the issue of getting rid of annoying guests became one of the most pressing for public discussions in the European Union. 

Poland hosted the most of Ukrainians but by now Poles are quite tired of them. Their presence in Poland is in fact the reason why Polish people are not so eager about the idea of returning former Polish territories promoted by certain forces in the country. They are fine with lands but they are not so fine with inhabitants of those lands.

General Waldemar Skrzypczak who commanded Polish land forces in 2006-2009, said that it could be a good idea to conduct mobilization among Ukrainian citizens on European territory. 

‚ÄúWe should start training new formations for the Ukrainian army together with NATO - in Poland, Germany, France and other countries. We can mobilize Ukrainian citizens who are in our countries, train them according to our standards, arm them and send them to the front,"" Skrzypczak said.

According to the general, the Ukrainian side is experiencing a huge shortage of human resources because there are so many immigrants, and they have problems replenishing them. ""It is in this way, which has already been tested since World War II, that we will be able to help Ukraine by deeds, not by empty deliveries of money and weapons,"" he added. 

So, it looks like Poles are thinking about a way to get rid of Ukrainian migrants with a profit, and it looks like they found such a way. Disposing of them as cannon fodder will serve several purposes and will bring Polish dream of returning West Ukraine land without its people even closer.

Some more balanced Ukrainian Telegram channels shared rumors about possible strike on gas transport system or termination of supplies to Europe from Russia. While usually such rumors indicate prepared provocation, this time it looks different. 

The option of complete termination of gas supplies to Europe has always been looming on the horizon. Russia is gradually preparing for it but doesn‚Äôt want to hurt its own economy with rush actions like the Europeans do. 

Of course, complete termination of Russian supplies would create big problems for Europe as well. As Russia is still unable to fully redirect its fuel supplies to East and South, we will have to stop production in emergency mode. This will create shortage on gas markets, gas prices will skyrocket, and Europeans will be happy to see just one trillion of losses like they had in 2022. 

While this option is not the best for Russia, it could still be considered as a response to Europeans sending heavier weapons to Ukraine including tanks. All those discussions in previous weeks show that they are quite reluctant to do so and are obviously pressured by the US. Maybe an extra push in the right direction could make them more willing to dispute the will of hegemon.

The United States are obvious winners in this scenario as with termination of all supplies from Russia Europe will be forced to pay any price for their LNG, and this situation will remain for a long time and even if Europe decides to make amends to Russia, restoration of supplies will take months if not years.   

Those reluctant supplies of tanks, armored vehicles and other things from Europe are not posing any direct threat to Russian Armed Forces because they are too diverse and are supplied in small quantities that aren‚Äôt sufficient to save Ukraine or turn the tide of conflict. 

However, those supplies boost AFU morale and pose a real nuisance. Yes, these supplies are weakening NATO countries and it‚Äôs good for Russia. Yes, for now Russia outmatches production capacity of arms industry of all NATO countries combined. However, this situation won‚Äôt stay for more than a year or two.

Moreover, those supplies are a sign of disrespect to Russia and Russian ‚Äúred lines‚Äù. Maybe time has come for a more decisive approach and more decisive responses. It‚Äôs time to bring SMO to its logical end and drawing a big red line for Europe should help. 

Russia has no real leverage against the United States but without European help US alone won‚Äôt be able to sustain the Ukrainian conflict. Their widely advertised ‚Äúlargest aid package‚Äù contains 100,000 artillery shells scraped from everywhere they could. Still, at current rates these Ukraine will use these shells within 20-30 days at most. 

So maybe it‚Äôs time to stop playing by European rules. They have accused Russia of energy blackmail for decades. How much longer will Russia tolerate this behavior and trade with enemies?",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2750.0,4.0,2023-01-23T10:28:19+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,30.0,MessageEntityBold,511.0,217.0,MessageEntityBold,887.0,152.0,MessageEntityBold,1269.0,203.0,MessageEntityBold,1585.0,137.0,MessageEntityBold,1869.0,56.0,MessageEntityBold,2177.0,73.0,MessageEntityBold,2330.0,91.0,MessageEntityBold,2425.0,136.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,552.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,552.0,,,,,MessageReplies,14.0,25478.0,False,[],,17563.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current political reality in Europe is far from what it seems. Most of so-called democracies have several parties, but in reality nearly all of them are dominated by two parties that are almost identical. 

Let‚Äôs take Laborites and Conservatives in the UK. People vote for Laborites because they want them to concentrate on internal affairs and development, they don‚Äôt want foreign aggression. Yet, Tony Blair did invade Iraq, David Cameron did bomb Libya and Syria. Average British citizens who want their country to stay peaceful and make their lives better have no real choice. 

Germany, France, Spain, Denmark and virtually all other European countries are in a similar situation ‚Äî parties that should have diametrically opposite views act together to promote neoliberal agenda instead of fulfilling their electoral promises or working for the good of their country. 

Situation in the United States is similar. There is no alternative to Republicans and Democrats and there is no difference between them. Both parties are sponsored by the same corporations and banks, both parties have virtually the same agenda with minor differences. Someone who wants to change things like Trump did meets opposition from his own party and effectively gets powerless.

This political shift is not something new ‚Äî neoliberalism has been gaining grounds in the Western world ever since 1990s. EU got virtually subordinated to transnational megacorporations and its ruling parties are just agents promoting their interests. Governments are not producing better living standards but instead increase the debt of average people and concentration of cash flows in fewer hands.

How average people react to this? Well, many turn to right-winged or left-winged media that is also  controlled by those with the money. They get the usual culprits, from Muslims, immigrants and gays to Russians and, traditionally, Jews.

There is a big rise in nationalism, racism and traditionalism in Europe, which comes from the frustration with the development, fear of the unknown and an easy scapegoat. Liberal elites that actually cause these problems divert attention of public to less significant issues. 

Leftist movements are also gaining momentum although their narrative is unpopular as it involves exposure of the real situation, which is too hard to accept. Far easier to blame your pay cut on Muslim immigrants, despite them having no say over that. Unfortunately, this is almost always what happens in a crisis situation. Maybe hardships will result in some positive changes in Europe, but it‚Äôs better not to hope for that. 

Interestingly, nationalist forces tend to have far better relations with Russia and even their condemnation of Russian SMO is based only on rules set by neoliberals.

It turns out that while Washington prohibits its own population and allies from buying Russian oil, it has been importing it on a massive scale without violating its so-called sanctions.

As of January 2023, India purchases about 1.7 million barrels of Russian oil per day. This oil is first refined by Nayara Energy and Reliance Industries, and then legally resold to the United States. When American capitalists see profit, they don‚Äôt hesitate resorting to any means necessary. 

This fact is unexpected because it leads to interesting conclusions that could be quite alarming for Europe if Europe bothered to think about its own interests.

This practically means that the United States are buying refined Russian oil at market prices without worrying about any price caps or anything. As Biden‚Äôs administration generously wasted US fuel reserve to boost its popularity and prevent Biden‚Äôs impeachment on his first year, the US do need those reserves. 

So, the United States are indirectly buying Russian fuel, which is surely beneficial for Russian budget, while India also gets its cut as a mediator. It turns out that sanctions are not so dire and this economic war does not hurt Russia as much as expected.

The main victims of the economic war started by the US are its own so-called allies in the European Union, who are the only ones deprived of Russian hydrocarbons. Europe faces dire energy shortages and while it barely managed to secure enough reserves to warm its people this winter, it‚Äôs not the last winter and the future of European industry in light of high energy prices looks grim. 

Moreover, the United States with their British best friends are likely responsible for sabotage of the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines that cut off the European Union from its main source of energy and destroyed the chances for swift recovery of ties in case of some future reconciliation.

Construction of these pipelines took decades and Russia invested quite a lot in it. With Europe having the insolence to blame Russia for explosions, Russia won‚Äôt enter any more joint projects until it receives proper compensations from all involved parties in addition to insurance payment. 

Germans recently started talking about rebuilding the North Stream pipelines. Sure thing, Russia can agree on that provided that Europeans do it by themselves and solve all the problems Russia faced. After all, these pipelines were the main reason for US interference in Ukraine. 

Europeans keep staying on their road to collective suicide and keep imposing sanctions on Russia and sending weapon to Ukrainian nazis with pure Russophobe motives. They don‚Äôt see who are their real enemies or don‚Äôt want to see.

As Russian special operation gradually but inevitably progresses, questions are arising about future of Ukraine and especially about formalization of this future.

Russian SMO objectives set some requirements to Ukraine and certain guarantees. However, it is necessary to understand what will those guarantees be and how to make Ukraine really comply with Russian demands. 

Zelensky regime in Kiev has already proven its inability to negotiate. Moreover, this clique cannot be considered truly independent as they completely depend on their Western masters and are unable to give any concessions, promises or obligations without their approval.

It doesn‚Äôt matter whether capitulation will be signed by Zelensky or someone else. It is very unlikely that existing Ukrainian regime will willingly amend Ukrainian laws and acknowledge new territorial realities. Besides, this is not just a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, this is a conflict between Russia and the West, so it would be better if the West directly participated in peace talks.

Ability of the West to enter any agreements also causes serious doubts. Europe cannot be trusted for sure. The story of Minsk agreements that were signed with the objective to fool Russia and arm Ukraine clearly shows that European guarantees are worth nothing. Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande conspired with Petro Poroshenko to deceive Russia. 

The United States are also not especially trustworthy. Whenever they don‚Äôt like any agreement, they just pull out of it. Whenever they want an excuse for something, they make up this excuse. Still, they are the only entity in the West that is capable of negotiations and can be trusted at least a slightest bit. 

Unfortunately, this year the United States will still have Biden‚Äôs administration. However, Russia cannot wait for more reasonable statesmen to come to power.

So, who can arrange peace negotiations and guarantee their fulfilment by Ukrainian side? United Nations organization is impotent and dominated by the West. Their formal acknowledgment of new realities is desirable but not necessary.

It is important to understand that while peace talks may end the hot phase of Ukrainian conflict, they will definitely not end economic war and will not make the West friends of Russia. So, using any West-dominated forums like the UN would be meaningless. 

There are several possible options of how to proceed. In optimal scenario Ukrainian peace deal has to be guaranteed by China, India and the United States. China would represent a side leaning to Russia, the U.S. would represent a side leaning to Ukraine and India would represent a truly neutral side. 

The forum can be provided by a country that hasn‚Äôt fully committed to one of the sides. Turkey is a good choice and it could be useful to invite it as yet another guarantor considering its interests in the region, ties with Russia and membership in NATO. 

Of course, this is just an ideal scenario. Still, most important thing for future talks will be keeping the fruits of victory for more than just a few years and making sure that the need for special military operation will never arise again.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2676.0,5.0,2023-01-16T17:48:52+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,39.0,MessageEntityBold,416.0,270.0,MessageEntityBold,1087.0,70.0,MessageEntityBold,1159.0,33.0,MessageEntityBold,1438.0,53.0,MessageEntityBold,2001.0,142.0,MessageEntityBold,2458.0,246.0,MessageEntityBold,2796.0,165.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,544.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,544.0,,,,,MessageReplies,6.0,25478.0,False,[],,17438.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2022 was marked with several breakthroughs in Russian cooperation with the OPEC and the rest of the Arab world. Even old allies like Saudi Arabia have now very cold relations with the United States and are looking to turn East. 

OPEC countries are staying out of Ukrainian conflict but it‚Äôs worth noting that they are not joining sanctions against Russia. Western seizure of Russian assets and sanctions on oil and gas supplies make them worry about their own future. They understand that they face the same risks if they will openly change direction, so their turn to the East is less noticeable than that of Russia. 

For now they are capitalizing on the conflict between Russia and the West and are earning even more mega-profits due to deficit on the market of fossil fuels and Western need to substitute Russian supplies. However, they think long term and make contracts with India and China as well.

One may think that they have problems fulfilling those contracts when a large part of their export is directed to the West. However, it looks like they settle this problem by making an agreement with Russia that substitutes their supplies for now. Russia supplies Asia, OPEC supplies Europe, everyone is happy.

Moreover, OPEC countries are working with Russia and large Asian importers to create a new global freight insurance system that would not be controlled by the West. This is a very important development. With such system all oil and gas exporting countries, not just Russia, will be virtually immune to sanctions from the West. 

In 2023 we will see continued work on creation of this system and maybe it will even get deployed. OPEC countries will continue their cooperation with Russia and maintain neutral stance with regard to Ukrainian conflict. 

Work on undermining the foundation of U.S. power will continue. OPEC countries were important contributors to present role of US dollar as the main global currency. Their willingness to switch to national currencies shows that they are ready to consider alternative. In 2023 we‚Äôll see even more contracts nominated not in USD but in Saudi riyal, Chinese yuan, Indian rupee, Russian ruble and other currencies of countries challenging the West-dominated world order.

For now, many Arab countries are not real Russian friends but situational allies. They share the same concerns and have similar objectives, but they cannot be relied on doing what Russia does and while they covertly support efforts to undermine US power in the world, they can still be coerced to join another camp.

So, in 2023 Russian diplomats will have an important task of drawing OPEC closer to Russian camp and expanding economic cooperation between Russia and Arab countries so that alternative currency initiatives would have backing in form of trade.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2997.0,5.0,2023-01-13T13:58:07+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,63.0,MessageEntityBold,295.0,125.0,MessageEntityBold,686.0,285.0,MessageEntityBold,1221.0,61.0,MessageEntityBold,1295.0,153.0,MessageEntityBold,1837.0,265.0,MessageEntityBold,2304.0,80.0,MessageEntityBold,2625.0,238.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,540.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,540.0,,,,,MessageReplies,3.0,25478.0,False,[],,17395.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Second week of January was marked with news about US sending more token military aid to Ukraine. Yet another U.S. military aid package includes about two dozen Bradley armored infantry vehicles. 

Reuters news reports speak about over 1,800 U.S. tanks and other armored vehicles arriving to Europe through the Netherlands and Denmark. This allegedly has the purpose of troop rotation, however it‚Äôs worth noting that supplies are going to Poland and Lithuania and these countries are not known for their good attitude to Russia or low involvement in Ukrainian conflict.

Moreover, Poland has already vouched to send a few tanks to Ukraine, so it is safe to assume that at least a part of new supplies will end up in hands of the Kiev regime. While the United States have not yet included tanks into their military aid packages, they are adding more and more items and Biden can say anything anytime, so Russia has to be ready for bad surprise.

However, situation is not dire and the risk is not so great as it may seem. A few armored infantry vehicles will not change the course of this conflict. Russian Armed Forces have destroyed them in many thousands, so this supply is only an indication of Ukrainian shortage of military equipment.

Situation with tanks is similar ‚Äî Ukraine has already lost more than it had by the beginning of SMO. Supplies of Soviet-era stocks have come to an end, repair capabilities are very limited because of Russian missile strikes, and so the enemy has very little options to maintain their resistance, not speaking about any offensive operations.

The West is sending military aid to Ukraine not to help it win, which is impossible and would be impossible even if the U.S. sent all those supplies right to Ukraine. The West is sending military aid to extend Ukrainian agony in attempts to weaken Russia as much as possible. 

However, they have been very reluctant to send their own weapons, and there are reasons for it. First and foremost, it‚Äôs more expensive than old Soviet stocks. Western stocks are also limited and supplying too much may leave them defenseless. Maybe old stuff that was scheduled for disposal. 

Then there is also a PR aspect ‚Äî losing these weapons and equipment to Russian Armed Forces is a huge blow to image of NATO armies. Moreover, it‚Äôs a reputation risk to Western arms industry, so they definitely won‚Äôt to see them in Ukraine in large numbers. 

Finally, Ukrainians are not really trained to operate those weapons or use them in mix with each other and with all other kind of weapons that are present at AFU. Kiev regime and its followers are demoralized, Ukrainian armed forces are barely holding together and no weapons can change that. 

Even if Biden goes completely nuts and does decide to send tanks to Ukraine, Russia can handle it. In fact, at the moment Russia can handle almost anything.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,3179.0,4.0,2023-01-13T10:34:05+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,28.0,MessageEntityBold,80.0,45.0,MessageEntityBold,227.0,136.0,MessageEntityBold,610.0,57.0,MessageEntityBold,1127.0,140.0,MessageEntityBold,1304.0,65.0,MessageEntityBold,1506.0,103.0,MessageEntityBold,1612.0,274.0,MessageEntityBold,2050.0,81.0,MessageEntityBold,2217.0,97.0,MessageEntityBold,2452.0,152.0,MessageEntityBold,2606.0,128.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,539.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,539.0,,,,,MessageReplies,6.0,25478.0,False,[],,17637.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2022 is coming to an end and it‚Äôs time to wrap up overall results of the year. 2022 was the year when the world has changed and the biggest thing that never left global headlines was the Russian special military operation in Ukraine. 

‚¨úÔ∏è How did it go? There are a lot of lies, fakes and deliberate misinformation surrounding the story. Massive misinformation campaign by the collective West made it perfectly clear that future historians will be debating it for a long time and even ultimate Russian victory will not end the flow of fakes. 

So, how did it go? We have seen three quite distinct stages with different objectives and different circumstances surrounding them.

‚ñ™Ô∏èThe first stage lasted from the very beginning of SMO on February 24th to termination of negotiations by Ukraine in April under falsified pretext. 

On this stage Russia has committed limited military contingent with a lot of restrictions and demonstrated its willingness to quickly end the operation as soon as its terms are met. 

It was obvious from the very beginning that Ukraine is not a match to Russia in military aspect and despite numerous media victories, Ukraine had a hard time dealing with limited Russian force. Russian objective at that period was not to conquer Ukraine or displace its government but to slap hands of Kiev regime, make it accept reality and establish new status quo without any major losses or damage to either side. 

Had it been just Ukraine, this objective would have succeeded. However, leadership of the United States decided that it is time to weaken Russia and test its power and got indirectly engaged in this conflict by undertaking the obligation to supply Ukraine with everything it needed to fight Russia. The objective of the U.S. was to fight Russia till the last Ukrainian and this objective has not changed.

‚ñ™Ô∏èThe second stage started in April. It was a strange time. Russia still restrained from using heavier weapons and hurting civilian infrastructure but enjoyed some successes such as capture of Mariupol. Meanwhile Ukraine was training its mobilized forces and arming them with weapons that were coming from the collective West at alarming speed. 

In the end of summer Ukraine did muster a large force and enjoyed some local successes. That was the time when Russia got more serious about the matter. It was no longer just Ukraine, Ukraine got bankrupt back in August. Russia was facing military and economic might of the collective West. However, giving up was never considered as an option.

This stage ended around September ‚Äì October after North Stream explosions, referendums in four former Ukrainian regions and a terrorist attack on Crimean bridge. This is when Russia got serious and started ‚ÄúShock and Awe‚Äù style operation. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èThis brings us to the third stage. While Russia is still trying to spare civilians, it no longer tries to spare Ukraine as a state. Long-range strikes have virtually disabled energy grid infrastructure in Ukraine and have now switched to disabling the remains of Ukrainian air defense. 

This tactic implies disruption and destruction of enemy ability to fight before launching the mass offensive that will roll over opposing country without any meaningful resistance. Naturally, sparing lives of Russian soldiers should be a priority on this stage and that is the logic behind all actions of Russian command including some seemingly controversial decisions like withdrawal from Kherson.

The chosen approach proved to be very successful and there are objective signs that the opposition is crumbling. Victory has not yet been achieved but there are little doubts that it will come. So let‚Äôs wish that the coming year, 2023, will be remembered as the year of Russian victory.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,4464.0,11.0,2022-12-30T09:02:59+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,0.0,2.0,MessageEntityBold,3.0,37.0,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,276.0,2.0,MessageEntityBold,279.0,14.0,MessageEntityBold,717.0,151.0,MessageEntityBold,1052.0,194.0,MessageEntityBold,1878.0,37.0,MessageEntityBold,2225.0,88.0,MessageEntityBold,2812.0,37.0,MessageEntityBold,3503.0,193.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,537.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,537.0,,,,,MessageReplies,7.0,25478.0,False,[],,17185.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Russian audience had some laugh, Western audience has largely dismissed it as irrelevant, but it did have some deeper meaning.

In fact, Medvedev‚Äôs forecast just mirrors various ridiculous statements of the Western media about Russia that we heard in the past years.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Increase of oil price to $150 per barrel and gas price to $5000 per 1000 cubic meters.

Yeah, we heard something like that too. Predictions of collapse for Eurasian Union, endless forecasts about the crash of ruble.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Conquest of western regions of former Ukraine by Poland and Hungary. 

Russia was accused of ambitions to conquer former USSR countries countless number of times. In fact, Polish conquest of West Ukraine sounds much more plausible than Russian conquest of Belarus, for example.

Another allusion to endless Western stories about Russian ‚Äúplans‚Äù to restore USSR in various configurations.

6Ô∏è‚É£ War between France and the Fourth Reich. Division of Europe, including new division of Poland.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Separation of Northern Ireland from UK and its return to Ireland.

Any guesses? Well, it‚Äôs about Kaliningrad. We have seen dozens of absolutely unrealistic scenarios of Kaliningrad region becoming a part of Germany, Poland, Lithuania and even Czechia. 

8Ô∏è‚É£ Civil War in the US, independence for California and Texas, Union State of Texas and Mexico. Elon Musk winning president elections in states that stay Republican after the Civil War.

Collapse of Russia and another Russian civil war is a wet dream of the collective West. They have a lot of maps with their desired outcomes. How about Russian maps?

A side note about Elon Musk. How many times we have heard about certain Mr. N. being the most popular figure in Russia and failing to become its leader only because of someone‚Äôs intrigues. Well, Musk is a much more likely candidate for US President.

9Ô∏è‚É£ Exodus of all largest stock exchanges and financial activities from US and Europe to Asia.

They wrote that Russia will be left alone. How about looking at it from a different angle?

üîü Crush of Bretton-Wood financial system, dissolution of IMF and the World Bank. Abandonment of euro and dollar as global reserve currencies. Return to gold standard. Active use of digital fiat currencies.

Experts acknowledge that European economy is already in recession and it will intensify next year even more. High inflation and energy shortage push a strong pressure on EU industry, salary increases are falling short behind inflation, consumer demand falls and this is triggering a chain reaction that will manifest most noticeably in the coming year.

This report greatly contradicts optimistic statements of European politicians, which in fact turn to be quite void. This year Europe managed to reduce its energy consumption by 20 percent. But how was it achieved? Despite widely publicized household energy-saving measures, they account just for a tiny bit of energy consumption. Expensive transition to energy-efficient technologies also helped a tiny bit, but the lion‚Äôs share of energy saving is due to reduced consumption by European industry. 

Plants are reducing production, businesses close, companies see lower profits and are looking for ways to cut costs. Facing much higher energy costs and falling demand they are virtually forced to ‚Äúoptimize‚Äù labor costs, resulting in even more unemployment, even lower demand and so on.

For many decades European industry was considered innovative and competitive, for many years European income level was considered relatively high as compared to most other countries. We knew that a good part of high income was compensated with high costs of living, but we thought that aside for that best European countries are really demonstrating outstanding competence in running their economies. 

However, it turned out that all of this was just an illusion and the real foundation of European competitiveness was very simple ‚Äî cheap Russian energy that it was getting from USSR and later Russia. With few exceptions such as Norway that has its own energy resources, the competitiveness of Europe was dependent on Russian energy and it was an incredible level of dependence that nobody could even imagine.

Energy prices impact industry not only directly through the energy it consumes but also indirectly through increased prices on components and higher costs of storage and transportation. Even slight increase in energy prices has multiplicative effect on manufacturing costs of final product. 

Now just think, Europe now pays 2-4 times more for its energy. Consumer sector is subsidized, but subsidies won‚Äôt work for industry. Paying billions to subsidize companies and getting back millions in taxes does not sound like a plan. It can work for a short period, but European pockets are not endless and the crisis spiral is already in motion. 

In face of inevitable increase of global demand for energy, the Eurozone sees itself in completely uncompetitive position. The euro bubble will sooner or later burst out, and European authorities can do little to prevent it.

Remaining power supply in cities of Ukraine exists only due to the goodwill of Moscow, but military needs may change it any moment. Ukrenergo has emergencies every day and only relatively warm weather prevents real problems at the moment. 

Power supply in Kiev is limited and evenly distributed through temporary grid reconnection measures, According to Ukrainian energy officials, it is hard to predict how reliably the equipment will cope with lower temperatures and higher consumption especially in light of new Russian missile and drone attacks. 

Kiev administration is no more optimistic. They acknowledged that emergency cutoffs will continue in the Ukrainian capital through the winter. According to Klichko‚Äôs deputy, more than 300 000 Kiev residents remained without power as of Wednesday morning, and Wednesday saw more air alerts with more damage. 

Ukraine‚Äôs deputy interior minister has confirmed this week that Russian attacks have destroyed over 35000 facilities across the country and damaged about 700 critical infrastructure facilities including gas pipelines, power substations and bridges. As Ukrainian officials tend to downplay their losses, the damage might be even more dire. 

Moreover, a large part of damage is irreparable and Western instigators of Ukrainian headless administrators have acknowledged it. Despite loud claims about United States being ready to supply Ukraine with everything it needs to restore infrastructure, U.S. energy companies have acknowledged that their equipment is incompatible with Ukrainian energy grid. 

As for the U.S. creating a new industry for that‚Ä¶ well, that is just delusional dream of Kiev regime. The States are not enthusiastic about helping Ukraine with anything, maybe with the exception of weapons to fight American nemesis.

Meanwhile Zelensky keeps demonstrating that common sense and Ukraine government are incompatible. In his address to Ukrainian legislators, he called for decentralization of Ukrainian energy system, saying it‚Äôs dangerous when cities depend on several big plants.  Moreover, he added that Ukraine should use green energy in the future to build a decentralized energy system that can‚Äôt be destroyed by missile strikes.  

üí• Decentralization? It‚Äôs hard to misinterpret this. Decentralization means that Ukraine should build a lot of new power plants. For the record, Ukraine has not built a single power plant since Soviet times. Not a single one. It received a working system and managed to preserve it, but that‚Äôs it. 

üåø Green energy? Well, Ukraine certainly needs windmills to fight, but green energy? In Ukraine? Even Europe does not do so well with its ‚Äúgreen energy‚Äù and is reopening coal-fueled thermal plants in desperate attempts to fight energy shortage. 

üí¨ Moreover, how will it be done? Re-electrification of Ukraine is a titanic task that would require strong industry, excellent engineers, honest supervisors and money. A lot of money. Do Ukrainians really hope that some good guy will come and fix their country out of pure kindness? They will face a big disappointment.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2722.0,3.0,2022-12-29T11:41:49+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,0.0,2.0,MessageEntityBold,3.0,178.0,MessageEntityBold,312.0,422.0,MessageEntityBold,777.0,99.0,MessageEntityBold,1744.0,235.0,MessageEntityBold,2398.0,2.0,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,2398.0,2.0,MessageEntityBold,2400.0,18.0,MessageEntityBold,2698.0,2.0,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,2698.0,2.0,MessageEntityBold,2700.0,14.0,MessageEntityBold,2945.0,2.0,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,2945.0,2.0,MessageEntityBold,2947.0,32.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,534.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,534.0,,,,,MessageReplies,5.0,25478.0,False,[],,17819.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nothing could be further from what is really going on. Russian leader is not asking for negotiations, he is just saying that Russia is open to diplomatic resolution of the conflict.

‚ñ™Ô∏èRussia has been ready to accept Ukrainian surrender ever since the beginning of the special operation, nothing changed here. Ukraine knows Russian terms and whatever is the picture that Western MSM try to create, this picture has little to do with reality. And the reality has been obvious from the very beginning.

As for guarantees, yes, it‚Äôs a hard question. Probably everyone in Russia remembers the story of Minsk Agreements that were never implemented while their supposed European guarantors have acknowledged that their objective was just ‚Äúwin time to arm Ukraine‚Äù. So, it is highly unlikely that Russia will agree to that sort of deal and step on the same rake once again. 

This time Russia will require permanent solution and more serious guarantees strengthened by immediate actions that have to be done before anything is signed. Yes, everyone needs guarantees. Ukraine may also need some guarantees, and Ukraine may even get those guarantees but it first has to make sure that the story of last eight years will never repeat.

‚ñ™Ô∏èFrom Russian side it is obvious that Russia will not accept any guarantees by Europe. The memory of European betrayal is too fresh. Guarantees will have to come from the United States in form of written binding agreements and they must include China as another guarantor to make sure US don‚Äôt forget their promises right when the ink gets dry.

‚ñ™Ô∏èAs for Ukraine, the initial Russian proposal was absolutely fair. If Russia, US and any willing European countries guarantee territorial integrity and safety of Ukraine, if Ukraine is fast-tracked to EU, it should feel safe enough to demilitarize. The only thing Russia objects to is any kind of NATO membership and NATO bases in new Ukraine in any form.

Demilitarization is obviously needed. As it stands now, Ukraine has the second largest army in Europe after Russia. Armed with NATO weapons, fielding NATO military equipment, using NATO air defense systems. Even before the conflict Ukraine was excessively militarized and its military was much larger than needed for a country of this scale.

‚ñ™Ô∏èSo, what will make Ukraine safe from Russian intervention in future? Constitutional amendments establishing neutrality of Ukraine and granting equal rights, freedom of speech and freedom of speaking native language to all its citizens.

‚ñ™Ô∏èThis kind of deal is the only deal that Ukraine can get. Territorial issue has to be resolved once and for all. Ukraine should not expect any better terms but they surely can get worse. Current terms are already worse than those offered in spring.

The idea that Ukraine has the right to demand something is misleading. Defeated country cannot demand anything.

Message,17064,1639836943,2022-12-28T17:01:30+00:00,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"Russia has finally responded to oil price restrictions implemented by European Union and the collective West. Yesterday President Putin has signed a decree that prohibits sale of oil and oil products under supply contracts that directly or indirectly specify any restrictions of prices. 

‚¨úÔ∏è The decree comes into effect on February 1st and will first apply only to supplies of oil. The government of the Russian Federation was ordered to prepare the timeframe and the list of oil products that will also be subject to new restriction.

While the oil part was expected and has been previously announced, adding oil products to the restriction list means that Russian response is very real and that these measures are not just for the show. 

‚¨úÔ∏è This is important because it shows that Russia won‚Äôt circumvent its own prohibition by supplying new products like ‚Äúcrude oil mix‚Äù in compliance with the price cap. The price cap is simply being dismissed. Russian oil exporters won‚Äôt be able to circumvent the decree for profit. 

Moreover, the decree refers to contracts, so any countries willing to buy Russian oil or oil products won‚Äôt be able to acknowledge the price cap even if the contract price falls within its limits. 

‚¨úÔ∏è It should have been clear from the very beginning that Russia will not accept any kind of restrictions. Western sanctions restrict shipment and insurance but Russian partners in Asia are already working on creation of alternative shipping and insurance schemes. 

OPEC countries and other oil exporters have already spoken against the price cap and this means that at the very least they will support Russia by reselling its oil and at the very best they will help Russia and its Asian partners with alternative shipment insurance structure that will be completely independent from the West.

Virtually all oil and gas exporters are outraged with European ideas to establish price restrictions. Even U.S. companies have spoken against the idea. This creates a precedent and this is a precedent that no seller would endorse. In fact, with this move the collective West has pushed OPEC+ to Russian camp. What they say is one thing, but what they think and what they do is another thing. 

‚¨úÔ∏è Current fluctuations of oil prices are not very relevant. Global demand for energy and energy prices greatly depend on Asia, the industrial powerhouse of the world. China, the largest economy in the world, is gradually lifting its COVID restrictions and as its industry will get into revival and growth mode, the demand for energy will skyrocket. 

Asia will have access to Russian resources and resources from the Middle East enjoying better prices. Europe will not enjoy this luxury. Of course, they can attempt to impose price cap on OPEC oil as well. In this case the cartel will respond and this response will be deadly. Neither Russia, nor OPEC will perish if they suspend supplies to Europe. They have alternative customers in the East. Europe doesn‚Äôt have this luxury.

‚ñ™Ô∏èMany people in Russia, Ukraine and even rest of the world hoped that the bloodshed will end this year. It looked like that non-violent resolution was close in spring and Russia has even withdrawn its forces from some regions as a gesture of goodwill. However, it turned out that Kiev regime was using negotiations to win time to mobilize people and secure weapon supplies from the West. As soon as they managed to do it, they immediately came with Bucha provocation sacrificing their own citizens for an excuse to withdraw from negotiations.

‚ñ™Ô∏èEver since spring the Ukrainian side backed by a notorious alliance of neocons and neoliberals in the United States has been denying reality and refusing any kind of talks with Russia. For several months until August Russia was still hoping that forces of reason in Ukraine will prevail and that Ukrainian people will overthrow the criminal regime that dragged them to this war. This did not happen. On the contrary, semi-fascist regime has strengthened its grip over Ukrainian people and started talking of its victory emboldened by seemingly endless supplies from their Western patrons.

By autumn Ukraine managed to mobilize a huge army on Western money and enjoyed some local successes. This made Zelensky and his cronies even more impudent and so-called leader of Ukraine has completely dismissed the idea of talks with Russia. Ever since then crazy addicts that took over Kiev have been absolutely confident in their victory. They did not worry that Ukraine got bankrupt back in summer, they did not worry about lives of their people and they did everything they could to escalate the conflict. 

Naturally, Russia did not sit idle and Russian Armed Forces got serious in face of terrorist attacks arranged by Ukraine and the collective West. While still trying sparing civilians, Russia resorted to missile and drone strikes against Ukrainian military facilities and dual-purpose infrastructure. These strikes were incredibly successful and any other country would get to its senses, but getting to senses is not about Ukraine. Zelensky‚Äôs government cannot be even called a government, it‚Äôs more like a colonial administration that strictly follows orders of its American masters.

Message,17030,1639836943,2022-12-28T07:39:36+00:00,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"üó£ On December 26th Russian president Vladimir Putin had an informal meeting with heads of CIS states at St. Petersburg. The meeting took place at the Presidential Library and was attended by leaders of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. 

Russian leader welcomed the decision of CIS member states to proclaim 2023 the year of Russian language. Next year will see a lot of activities to support the Russian language and increase its status as international communication language.

""Our nations have very many ties: common history, spiritual roots, deep integration of cultures, values and traditions and, of course, Russian language that is a powerful force joining our multi-ethnic states‚Äù, - said the President. 

At the moment Russian language has the status of state language in Russia and Belarus and the status of official language in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. It has also some official status in autonomies of Moldova, which was notably absent at the meeting. Moldova has suspended its participation in CIS a little more than a month ago under the pressure of its pro-Western elites that still dream of entering EU and were recently awarded candidate status. Still, moods in Moldavian society are mixed and it‚Äôs likely that it‚Äôs just a game aimed to get a gas discount.

While CIS by itself is a very loose block, it served as a backbone for Collective Security Treaty Organization and Eurasian Economic Union, which are much more advanced projects that offer tighter integration opportunities.

As the leading country of CSTO and EAU, Russia has some weight to promote its initiatives related to Russian language. Russia needs to expand its influence and with regard to that it‚Äôs very important to promote the status of Russian language and maybe even tie it with economic benefits. 

In Soviet times Russian language has been the lingua franca of Eastern Europe and the entire USSR. It had the role of inter-ethnic communication language and this role can still be restored, at least on a more limited scale. CIS spans ten countries with total population about 250 million and expanded use of Russian language will strengthen ties of those countries with Russia. Russian remains the language of science and engineering in most of CIS states and opens them a way to get familiar with rich Russian cultural heritage.

‚ñ™Ô∏èNot so long ago CIS had two more countries ‚Äî Georgia and Ukraine. These countries have left CIS for a reason, and while Georgia has returned to the path of reconciliation after disappointment with Western puppeteers who attempted to turn it into what is now Ukraine. It took time, but Georgia is gradually returning to pragmatic relations with Russia as its only large trade partner. 

Territorial conflicts are still there and they still need to be resolved but it is quite possible that after successful resolution of Ukrainian conflict in favor of Russia, Georgia will quickly come up with better proposals that will end the feud that lasts for more than three decades and will finalize the status of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. 

As for Ukraine, the language issue is one of the main reasons for the present conflict. Semi-fascist regime sponsored by Western enemies of Russia did everything it could to fight Russian language in Ukraine. They succeeded it to an extent and removal of Russian language from schools resulted in ukrainization of a whole generation. 

Another importance of Russian language is that its speakers can understand and promote Russian point of view and debunk propaganda coming from the collective West. It‚Äôs not just about Ukraine ‚Äî there are seeds of color revolutions in many CIS countries. To counter them, Russia needs to increase its soft power and promoting Russian language is very important for this.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2048.0,5.0,2022-12-28T07:41:23+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,0.0,2.0,MessageEntityBold,3.0,297.0,MessageEntityItalic,542.0,209.0,MessageEntityBold,764.0,164.0,MessageEntityBold,1340.0,225.0,MessageEntityBold,1855.0,98.0,MessageEntityBold,2389.0,386.0,MessageEntityBold,3123.0,208.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,527.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,527.0,,,,,MessageReplies,1.0,25478.0,False,[],,17031.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They don‚Äôt understand why can‚Äôt Russians or Chinese just get along with the West and make money like countries like Germany, Poland, Japan or Sweden. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èIt‚Äôs simple. The Germans, Poles, Japanese and Swedes are interested in their well-being more than in their sovereignty. While some of them object to Western values and woke culture, they still have to embrace and accept them. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èEconomic benefits come together with political and cultural requirements and those economic benefits for countries of the collective West are often ethereal. The United States view European Union as their own playground and always put their own interests above European interests. The entire economic burden of sanctions against Russia in 2022 rests on shoulders of Europeans. Americans just profit on European problems and see nothing wrong about it. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èCountries like Russia and China prefer following their own culture and traditions instead of embracing woke liberalism and universal US culture. Life is a bit easier for China as it has already realized its economic potential and managed to become the first economy in the world.

Russia still has to restore its own economic potential and if Russia wants to preserve its sovereignty, this requires economic expansion. Eurasian Union is the Russian economic expansion project and it was progressing well until clashing with EU‚Äôs economic expansion project. 

EAU is still moving on but losing the critical country for its success has definitely stalled its development. With Ukraine it could quickly achieve the economic level of USSR without many Soviet flaws.

Countries like Germany, Poland, Japan and Sweden are part of US/EU economic expansion project. In last decade Germany looked as if it had some ambitions to split away as leader of EU block and make it less dependent on the U.S. However, the events of this year have crossed this out. Things could have played differently but challenging U.S. would take a strong leader caring solely about interests of his people and Germany doesn‚Äôt have one.

Countries like Japan and South Korea don‚Äôt have any real alternative to being in U.S. economic block as they are unable to compete with China and even with each other in their geographical region and China won‚Äôt accept them as partners in its own economic integration projects for historic reasons.

Russian and Chinese foreign policies are rational. In modern world large countries need markets to export their goods and to grow their economy. China has sufficient internal market for self-propelled growth, so its economic expansion is less hasty, more well-thought and goes smoother than for Russia. 

Russia doesn‚Äôt have sufficient internal market and its location does not give it many options for economic expansion. Bringing large countries in your economic block is a hard and long process and those countries have to be friendly to you and aligned with your goals.

After the West devoured Eastern Europe and made it a part of their market, the territory of ex-USSR became its next target for expansion. Unfortunately, Russian activity and influence in post-Soviet space were not effective enough to counter the creeping threat of Western NGOs. Lessons have to be learned for the future. Russia cannot afford to lose any more of its allies.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2129.0,5.0,2022-12-26T11:04:03+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,0.0,2.0,MessageEntityBold,3.0,389.0,MessageEntityBold,502.0,158.0,MessageEntityBold,958.0,145.0,MessageEntityBold,2465.0,50.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,525.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,525.0,,,,,MessageReplies,4.0,25478.0,False,[],,17109.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ever since the beginning of the Ukrainian conflict mass media of the collective West has continuously been mocking old tank models used by Donbass militia and pretended that this is a sign of ‚ÄúRussian weakness‚Äù and ‚Äúshortage of modern tanks‚Äù. 

Ukrainian reports that grossly exaggerate Russian losses in the beginning of SMO have settled in global information space. As it commonly happens with Russophobe fakes, they are now taken for granted and are even used as a basis for decisions of Western politicians. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èThe fakes are really easy to debunk. For example, Ukraine claims to have captured over 500 functional Russian tanks including nearly 200 T-72B3 tanks. But where are those tanks? Shouldn‚Äôt Ukraine be able to field three tank brigades only with T-72B3 and another five brigades with other tanks? This number is more than a half of what Ukraine had before SMO started. 

Briefings of Russian Ministry of Defense usually provide combined statistics on destroyed tanks and other armored vehicles. While exact information on destroyed tanks is unavailable, it is safe to estimate that Ukraine has already lost well over a half if not all of its pre-SMO tanks. Ukrainian reports on the state of their tank forces often contain data on some virtual tank brigades that have been never seen in reality. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èOf course, the West does attempt to replenish Ukrainian losses. However, their capabilities look very limited. They supplied Ukraine with T-72M1 tanks from Eastern Europe and it‚Äôs apparent that the stocks are now over as they have switched to supplies of T-55s from ex-Yugoslavia. There are even talks about supplying older tanks from stock reserves of Saddam Hussain and Muamar Gaddafi that have been captured by the West in Iraq and Libya.

Still, this raises another big question ‚Äî where are the tanks? The West has no problems supplying Ukraine with large batches of offroad lightly armored vehicles, but where are the tanks?

Where are the Leclercs, the Leopards, the Challengers and the Abrams? The United States have thousands of Abrams in their reserves, why are they not sent to Ukraine? Why does Germany keeps delaying its promised supplies of Leopard 2 for many months and is likely to dump this supply altogether?

There are several reasons for that, but the main reason is PR. The military still has some say about real situation and the military understands that those tanks will be destroyed as well as Soviet era tanks Ukraine is using. There is no defense against Krasnopol heavy artillery shell landing on the roof of a tank.  

Loss of NATO tank forces after ten months of talking about Russian weakness will deal a PR blow that will be very hard to circumvent. While AFU losses can be attributed to Russia with some minor photoshopping, Western tanks are easily distinguishable from Russian tanks and it is impossible to hide their losses. The resulting embarrassment may result in another military challenge that the West is not ready to face

Even if NATO goes all in, completely empties its European tank stocks and sends thousands of tanks to Ukraine, they will still not be a match to Russian tank forces in numbers and won‚Äôt turn the tide of the conflict but will leave Europe entirely defenseless.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2862.0,5.0,2022-12-23T13:01:49+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,0.0,2.0,MessageEntityBold,3.0,267.0,MessageEntityBold,541.0,37.0,MessageEntityBold,909.0,124.0,MessageEntityBold,1338.0,110.0,MessageEntityBold,1781.0,484.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,523.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,523.0,,,,,MessageReplies,39.0,25478.0,False,[],,17146.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The UN Food and Agriculture organization has been created to fight global hunger and help developing countries improve their agriculture and food independence. 

As elections of the new chairman are nearing, the Western media has initiated a wave of hate publications against Qu Dongyu, former vice minister of agriculture and rural development of China. They accuse him of many things and the main accusation sounds as ‚Äúreluctance to condemn Russia for invasion of Ukraine‚Äù. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èChinese representative was elected almost four years ago mainly because he ran against competing candidates from Europe and the USA. During his term he did a lot to really improve situation with food safety in poorest countries of the world. However, he rarely hesitated to speak against the narrative of the collective West.

‚ÄúYou are looking at money, I‚Äôm looking to change the business model because I‚Äôm a farmer of small poor, family. You from the rich countries, you consider the money first, I consider wisdom first. It‚Äôs a different mentality"". This kind of statements made Qu Dongyu unpopular among Western elites because they see them as blasphemy and an attempt to disrupt neo-colonial model that is one of the cornerstones of Western prosperity. 

This year FAO desperately tried to stay out of politics and avoided speaking against Russia despite unprecedented pressure of the Western members. It played an important role in the famous ‚Äúgrain deal‚Äù and Chinese chairman tried to do his best to help it work. He tried to act in the interested of poor countries instead of appeasing the collective West and that enraged the Western media.

However, FAO is not the only UN organization responsible for food distribution. It has a competing agency, WFP (World Food Programme) that has been tightly controlled by U.S. for a very long time and does not step an inch from the ‚Äúparty line‚Äù of Washington establishment. 

It is likely that Europe and US will now nominate a single candidate for FAO chairman post. They will surely continue their slander campaign full of racist remarks, accusations of bias and claims of blasphemous idea to help countries grow food instead of just doing some charity. 

In any case, the countries that Qu will likely count on to be re-elected are not so interested in the political machinations of the West or its condemnation of the Russia's war in Ukraine, which it seeks to impress upon FAO's top leadership. The third world has to make a say here.

This situation is not unique. The collective West puts unprecedented pressure on all other UN agencies that are supposed to be out of politics and above any conflicts. Attempts of the collective West to turn UN into a closed club for themselves are diminishing UN role in the world and undermining its authority, which was not so high to begin with.

UN reforms are long due and maybe the present conflict between Russia and the collective West will ultimately result either in collapse of UN or in its deep reforms and transformation to a really impartial organization working for global benefit.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2403.0,5.0,2022-12-23T11:07:42+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,0.0,2.0,MessageEntityBold,3.0,239.0,MessageEntityItalic,887.0,223.0,MessageEntityBold,1112.0,207.0,MessageEntityBold,1710.0,275.0,MessageEntityBold,2550.0,351.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,522.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,522.0,,,,,MessageReplies,3.0,25478.0,False,[],,17106.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ten months have passed since the onset of the Special Military Operation of Russian Armed Forces in Ukraine. 

Situation on Ukrainian front is a common knowledge, but it is not the only front. SMO marked a new stage in conflict between globalist vision of the collective West and vision of independent countries that want to maintain their sovereignty, culture and traditions and to develop their own way without following woke patterns.

Military aspect of the operation was secondary from the very onset. The main part of the conflict was going in different dimensions. Ten months is sufficiently long period of time to watch for intermediate results, so let‚Äôs see what has Russia gained.

‚¨úÔ∏è Russia managed to undermine the global faith in US dollar. While in the beginning of the year the whole world was skeptical about the possibility of that, in November and December international deals in rubles, rupees and yuan became a routine deal.

‚¨úÔ∏è Russia managed to undermine global faith in Western democracy and freedom. The West has shown their true face by blatantly manipulating public opinion, censoring Russian channels and attempting to shut down any information sources that contradict their narrative.

‚¨úÔ∏è Russia managed to undermine the global faith in Western financial institutions. The collective West has shown their true face by freezing Russian assets, which is now becoming a trend. Even firm allies of the US in the third world are now worried about what can happen if they displease the hegemon. 

‚¨úÔ∏è Russia managed to give a kickstart to a new world order with more and more countries drifting to BRICS and its alternative economic projects aiming to steer away from the collective West that ties economic benefits with demands to embrace Western culture and Western values no matter how alien they are to the country in question. 

‚¨úÔ∏è Russia managed to split a crack between U.S. and its EU allies. In face of energy crisis the U.S. has turned to prey on Europe and not all Europeans are happy about it. Moreover, the U.S. is aiming to lure European industry to the Western hemisphere and impotent EU leaders can do little to oppose that.

‚¨úÔ∏è Russia managed to undermine the global faith in American and European defense industries. It turned out that they are not able to sustain even a second-rate military conflict against a strong adversary without stripping off reserve supplies of their own military forces. 

‚¨úÔ∏è Russia managed to survive the hardest blow that the collective West could deal ‚Äî unprecedented economic sanctions, severance of trade ties and withdrawal of a large part of Western companies from Russia. Moreover, economic consequences for Russia are much less than those suffered by the West.

His talks to Biden were not marked with any surprises, demented Santa was in a mood and gave the bad boy a bad toy. One Patriot battery to save Iranian people, or so granddad Joe said. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èZelensky‚Äôs speech at Congress was also nothing remarkable. He thanked lawmakers for ‚Äúfinancial packages you have already provided us‚Äù but noted: ‚ÄúYour money is not charity. It is an investment in global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way.‚Äù

This is definitely the case. The self-proclaimed champion of global security and democracy perfectly knows that American money don‚Äôt come as charity. Unborn generations of Ukrainians will surely thank him while they will be working all their lives to repay this ‚Äúcharity‚Äù. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èAs usual, American President casually reminded that the U.S. is doing nothing to escalate the conflict and supplies weapons exclusively for defense purposes. 

Naturally, Ukrainians must be thankful to Americans and Europeans that they are already fighting for months and are expected to fight for years without money, food, fuel and electricity but with brand new American weapons that are worth testing in real combat.

One Patriot battery costs one billion dollars. Zelensky will be eaten alive if he loses it, so we are unlikely to see it anywhere east of Lviv or even east of Polish border. That is unless Zelensky chooses to work his magic, and the ‚Äúdestroyed‚Äù Patriot battery will show up somewhere in East Nigeria or Kabul.

When asked about his readiness for peace Zelensky did not say anything new. According to Zelensky, he is not yet ready for compromises. Very well, he means that denazification has to continue until Zelensky is left to fight alone. 

Even his sketches are already boring. His outfit was mocked as that of a strip club manager and it looks like he was officially the first person in history to address U.S. Congress wearing a sweatshirt. 

Many Americans notice it and ask very hard questions that Biden‚Äôs administration will have big problems to answer. 

Tucker Carlson worded these questions perfectly: 

So the leader of a foreign government dressed in a sweatshirt waltzes into the United States Congress and starts demanding money. And then has the gall to tell the people sitting there, who are giving him tens of billions of dollars more of your money, that it is not charity, it's an investment. Really, what are the returns on that? And by the way, what's the point of it? What is the goal here? What's the justification for it? Do we have a historic debt to Ukraine? Do we have a historic animosity with a non-Soviet Russia? No, no. How do we win here? What's in it for us? Isn't this our country? And where do you get off talking to us like that? Do we hate ourselves so much? Do we have so little respect for the United States of America that we put up with that, that we'll applaud it? Thank you, sir. May I have another? What's wrong with us? What's wrong with our leaders? And where is this going?

Initially it was thought that direct NATO interference may turn the tide of this conflict. However, recent news about the state of German military with their faulty equipment and artillery give grounds to think that Europe has already invested all it could in Ukraine and that any further commitments will just leave Europe defenseless. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èThis week has also seen news that Polish military is turning into strongest in EU, Polish mercenaries fight and die in Ukraine in thousands and there are strong rumors about Poland preparing annexation of West Ukrainian regions. Polish people are not very happy about it and strongly stand against the idea to go dying for ‚ÄúGreater Poland‚Äù and especially for US hegemony. 

After Polish Defense Ministry announced plans to call 200 thousand reservists for ‚Äúmilitary training‚Äù, many Poles fled the country while many others have started protesting near military enlistment offices. 

No matter if rumors about Polish annexation are true or not, it‚Äôs worth to discuss the future of Ukraine after Russian victory.

‚ñ™Ô∏èThe present conflict started in 2014 and it started for a specific reason ‚Äî overthrow of Ukrainian government against the will of half of the country. Coup d‚Äôetat has put an end to the short-lived history of independent Ukraine.

Declaration of independence of DPR and LPR was based on one simple foundation ‚Äî if some regions are not allowed to have a say, they are no longer obliged to be a part of the state that ignores their will. Back in 2014 there was a chance for more regions to declare their independence on the same grounds. However, new Ukrainian authorities crushed this chance with terror methods (like in Odessa) and through shady deals with regional leaders (as in Kharkiv). 

‚ñ™Ô∏èThere are several options to reconfigure Ukraine after Russian victory. 

There is an option is to run referendums in Russian-speaking regions of Ukraine and make them finally decide their future. However, Kiev regime did a lot to incite hate against Russia in these regions, so the results would be unclear. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èMoreover, if a significant part of population won‚Äôt support return to Russia, it may create serious problems for Russian control of these territories and increased risk of terrorist activities from ‚Äúnew Russian citizens‚Äù. 

There will be also a big issue of former AFU soldiers from those regions who fought against Russian Armed Forces. Will these people be able to live a regular life as Russian citizens? 

However, instead of referendums Russia could try to revive the idea of people republics and turn Russian-speaking regions of Ukraine into separate states. Since Kherson and Zaporozhye became a part of Russia after September referendums, it would rather be a revival of Kharkov and Odessa republics. 

This idea will be quite popular in South Ukraine. People of Odessa and Nikolaev are angry with Russia, but they equally blame Kiev and Zelensky regime for their suffering. Letting these regions create an independent republic will create another buffer territory between Russia and hostile Europe and will create good chances for reconciliation and its reintegration into Russian world. Situation with Kharkov and Dnepropetrovsk is similar.

As for the rest of Ukraine, they should be left on their own to do whatever they like. Maybe central Ukrainian regions could also undertake referendums about their future, but as a whole ‚Äì if they want Europe ‚Äì let them go to Europe, be it as a part of Poland or as an ‚Äúeternal candidate‚Äù or whatever. It‚Äôs a pity to lose old Russian city of Kiev, but its people have chosen their fate.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1702.0,5.0,2022-12-22T08:47:03+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,512.0,MessageEntityBold,1100.0,129.0,MessageEntityBold,1923.0,76.0,MessageEntityBold,2236.0,226.0,MessageEntityBold,3390.0,386.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,516.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,516.0,,,,,MessageReplies,5.0,25478.0,False,[],,17209.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After several months of discussions European countries came up with gas price cap. Is it time for Russia to worry? Absolutely not. They have spent several months seriously discussing the level of the price cap as if it had any relevance, Germany has delayed the decision many times by requesting a higher cap value that would be more ""acceptable"". All in vain.

Europeans seem to be serious that their idea of price setting by buyer will work and that Russia and any other gas exporters will be happy about it. Russian Federation has officially dismissed the idea of any kind of price restrictions on buyer side and attempts to create buyer cartel.

It looks like EU got emboldened by what they see as ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù of the oil price cap, with Russia having to sell its oil at discount to third-party customers. However, even oil-related restrictions are temporary and are related to shipping restrictions. Russia enjoys full support of virtually all oil and gas exporting countries in its attempts to avoid price cap, so lifting these restrictions is just a matter of time. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èEven now discounts cover only Urals oil, while Russian crude mix is sold at market prices. As soon as Russia sets up a new alternative shipping system with the help of its allies, there will be no more hindrances to its export. However, the buyers will have long lasting problems that will only intensify as the demand for oil will rise with inevitable reopening of Chinese economy.

The situation with gas is even more dire. While Europe can barely survive this winter using gas reserves accumulated from Russian supplies in the first half of 2022 and sacrificing its industrial needs, the story does not end here.

2023-2024 heating season will be the toughest for Europe and situation won‚Äôt get better. Eventually they will run out of money and as their industry flees to the U.S. and China, there will be no new money coming.

Purchase of LNG from the United States combined with supplies from Norway will never cover full needs of the European Union. Even when Europe will build full-scale LNG infrastructure, it will still face shortage of supplies and will depend on LNG exporting countries much more than it depends on Russia. 

One of those LNG exporters is Qatar and its supplies will be critical for the few coming years in EU. However, recent EU corruption scandal involving Qatar is unlikely to cause good feelings and bring EU any trade preferences. While Chinese leader Xi Jingping has recently secured a record 27 year contract with one of the largest Arabian LNG exporters, European advances were less welcome. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èQatar traditionally separates politics from economic deals but European actions will definitely make it wary. Expected global energy deficit will be amplified by ‚Äúgreen energy‚Äù initiatives, reopening of Chinese economy, reduction of Russian exports and industrial growth of South and South-East Asia.

So, yes, it‚Äôs time to worry for Europeans. The idea of buyer cartel under any excuses will alienate virtually all suppliers and this does include American companies as well. And Russian official response has yet to come‚Ä¶",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1693.0,1.0,2022-12-21T11:04:58+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,183.0,MessageEntityBold,418.0,146.0,MessageEntityBold,706.0,156.0,MessageEntityBold,1128.0,386.0,MessageEntityBold,1961.0,306.0,MessageEntityBold,2660.0,304.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,513.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,513.0,,,,,MessageReplies,3.0,25478.0,False,[],,17207.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Massive Russian strikes over Ukrainian energy grid with missiles and drones have virtually achieved their results. The power grid is down and this seriously hinders mobility of enemy forces, supplies and whatever is left of Ukrainian arms industry.

While Zelensky‚Äôs regime is trying to pretend that nothing serious has happened, they have already prohibited citizens talk about blackouts publicly. They pretend that those without electricity are a part of ‚Äúthe unfortunate 1 percent‚Äù. That‚Äôs their usual math, the one they use to calculate casualties, secure financial aid and so on. 

Kiev rulers are acting as if they have already secured victory, and this makes sense for them ‚Äî nobody will send money to losers and extracting money from the West is becoming the favorite sport of Zelensky and Co.

They are virtually forcing citizens to stay at cities without stable supply of power, hot water and central heating. They lie because they need to show a nice picture to their sponsors. We have always known that well-being of civilians has zero relevance to Kiev regime, they have already proven it with there endless shelling of Donbass. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èBy the way, that shelling still continues ‚Äî while people in the West were watching FIFA World Cup, Ukrainian artillery have launched a massive strike against civilian hospital in Donetsk that involved casualties. It was just the last of the series of similar strikes against residential buildings, temples, cafes and other civilian infrastructure. 

These strikes have no military sense, there were no military objects or armed forces in the vicinity of impacted areas. In fact, they perfectly fit definition of war crime. Moreover, Ukraine still claims Donetsk to be its territory but it does not have any concerns about people that it wants to return‚Ä¶ or not. In fact, it‚Äôs common knowledge that Ukraine just wants those rich lands, no people needed. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èThe Ukrainian regime enforces ‚Äústay home‚Äù agenda for several reasons, and the main reason is that if Zelensky allows people to leave, Ukraine will get empty. EU will face another migration crisis while it hasn‚Äôt even barely accommodated to the previous one. Several more millions of Ukrainian migrants in EU will inevitably cause an explosion among local people and they will start looking for someone responsible. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èZelensky is too minor figure to answer for all European problems but his helpers are still around ‚ÄîEU parliament, EU government, leaders of EU countries. All those proponents of ‚Äúsolidarity with Ukraine‚Äù who decided that a chance for a victorious war is worth suffering of their people. No way.

So, Ukrainian energy grid is down. Zelensky regime may extend its agony by a couple more weeks with help of Europeans, so Russian pressure has to continue. Next priority targets are air defense, supply lines and fuel facilities. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èThe greater is the Russian pressure, the higher is the chance that Zelensky will no longer be able to hide the truth from his sponsors and, more importantly, from his people.

Henry Kissinger, a ninety-nine-year-old veteran of international politics, published an article in the Spectator, where he proposed his own solution of the Ukrainian crisis. His proposal can be viewed as a sign of what the collective West can offer Russia, and for now this is only one thing ‚Äî international recognition of status quo before February. This is absolutely unacceptable to Russia and a seasoned diplomat deeply respected by Putin could offer something more realistic.

It is unclear whether the collective West understands that its offers are futile and whether they are objectively assessing the situation in Ukraine. Such offers should not be coming in view of imminent collapse of Ukrainian state. It would sound as if Hitler proposed to return to 1939 borders in 1945.

Moreover, this offer like all previous Western offers concentrate on territorial issues. Looks like they don‚Äôt see that Russian primary objective in Ukraine is not territorial expansion of the Russian Federation but denazification of Ukrainian state as none of their ‚Äúpeace plans‚Äù cover this issue. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èWhat kind of proposal would be acceptable to Russia? Russian terms are well known and they include much more than acknowledgment of referendums in new Russian regions. However, Russia does not refuse to talk without any preliminary conditions. So maybe instead of voicing half-hearted proposals through retired diplomats, the West should indeed start talking. 

üî∫For starters, Western powers have to cease supplies of weapons and ammunition to Kiev regime and withdraw all their military personnel from the territory of former Ukrainian SSR. Ukrainian troops have to lay down weapons and withdraw from territory of new regions of the Russian Federation. All attacks against Russian military forces and civilians have to be stopped.

üî∫However, even this will not be enough. The Ukrainian crisis has to be solved once and for all but it‚Äôs just a manifestation of the conflict between Russia and the West. European leaders are right when they speak about the need for new security framework in Europe and they are right that such a framework cannot exist without Russia. 

The very paradox of the situation is that NATO understands that it cannot win a conventional or unconventional war against Russia. They are pushing, trying to overstretch Russia, trying to incite a color revolution for regime change, trying to strangle Russia economically. However, they cannot resort to direct and open use of force because it will be the end of them as well. 

So, NATO-Russia talks are also a must and these talks should be aimed to discuss the future of NATO and its existence or dissolution in post-Ukrainian world.

What about talking to Ukraine? Well, Ukraine is not capable of negotiations and it is not an independent subject of the international policy. Ukraine has been defeated around August. Objectives of Kiev regime have nothing to do with well-being of Ukrainian people, desire for peace and long-term stability in the region.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2220.0,3.0,2022-12-19T10:20:44+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,44.0,MessageEntityBold,220.0,457.0,MessageEntityBold,1137.0,52.0,MessageEntityBold,2589.0,159.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,511.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,511.0,,,,,MessageReplies,12.0,25478.0,False,[],,17188.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to reports, the volley had more 60 missiles, most of which have successfully hit the intended targets. 

üî∫This strike followed a statement by Pentagon earlier this week that Russian forces are running out of ammunition and that they will run out of it very soon. It looks like a Russian response to this statement as well as Ukrainian allegations that Russia produces only 40 missile in a months and will have its stockpiles depleted soon. 

üî∫Naturally, Pentagon and Kiev have no access to real information about the capacity of Russian missile industry. We have been hearing statements that Russia ran out of missiles ever since the beginning of SMO. We have been continuously hearing that Russia has scraped its last reserves and is buying old missiles from countries like North Korea and Iran.

However, non-stop series of missile strikes since October proves that wishful thinking of Kiev regime and their American and European sponsors has nothing to do with reality. Strikes come every day, every day Ukraine has air alert and every day Zelensky and Co. keep lying to their people that Ukrainian victory is close.

üî∫It‚Äôs worth noting that while Russia enjoys air superiority in Ukraine and enemy aircraft has virtually not chances, Russian Aerospace Forces don‚Äôt yet enjoy complete air dominance as the remains of Ukrainian air defense batteries and antiaircraft weapons make it not worth risking Russian bomber planes.  

When air defense capabilities of the enemy will be reduced to negligible level, missile strikes will be followed by bomb strikes. The opposite side understands it and desperately tries to boost Ukrainian air and missile defense capabilities, however this just doesn‚Äôt work.

üî∫Moreover, Russian forces have resumed use of Geran-2 drones and other UAVs against enemy defenses, military and dual-purpose infrastructure. Neither Ukraine, not even NATO have the capabilities to repeal this type of combined attacks and it looks like Russian arms industry was much better prepared for this kind of conflict than industries of the entire collective West.

There have been no reports of any shortages of ammunition, there have not been a single week without massive missile strikes since October 10th. While NATO factories are desperately being repurposed for different types of production in a process that will take many months if not years, Russian defense factories are working three shifts and keep expanding their production volumes.

Last week the enemy acknowledged loss of 50% of their energy grid infrastructure. 3-5 more successful volleys like the one launched today will bring the damage level to over 70 percent, which will make it irreparable and will greatly restrict enemy‚Äôs abilities to move supplies and forces. 

That‚Äôs why any talks of some future Ukrainian offensives may cause only laughter. They surely may launch some last-chance suicide attacks, but it is unlikely that they will achieve any notable successes while any kind of military victory is virtually impossible without direct full-scale intervention of all NATO countries‚Ä¶ and even then Russia would have far better chances than anyone could have expected.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2381.0,2.0,2022-12-17T12:09:40+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,248.0,MessageEntityBold,2612.0,292.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,509.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,509.0,,,,,MessageReplies,6.0,25478.0,False,[],,16821.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mateusz Morawiecki spoke to journalists before European Council meeting in Brussels and said that Europe is currently looking for money to implement continuously postponed ‚Äúgas price cap‚Äù. According to Morawiecki, the EU should confiscate Russian oligarchs' assets to help Ukraine and European citizens.

""The money is there, it is USD 350 billion, with some suggesting it could be USD 400 billion, which could be used to reconstruct Ukraine and ease the consequences of the Russian aggression for European citizens,"" the prime minister said.

Last time when EU talked about frozen Russian money, they mentioned only Ukraine. Now they aim to ‚Äúease the consequences of the Russian aggression for European citizens.‚Äù What a nice way to say: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll steal this money no matter what‚Äù. Morawiecki naturally vouches for ‚Äúusing this money to help countries that host Ukrainian immigrants‚Äù as Poland is the top destination for Ukrainian.

‚ñ™Ô∏èThe initial sanctions in form of freezing foreign assets of the Russian Federation have already dealt a huge blow to world‚Äôs trust to the West. The United States are smart enough and rich enough to avoid talking about any kind of confiscation. However, Europe went all in about its crusade for self-destruction, and first signs of this are already manifesting ‚Äî they are getting low on money. Investors are reluctant to trust their assets to institutions that cannot guarantee safety of these assets. 

Three fourths of the world views anti-Russian sanctions as arbitrary and has rightful reasons to worry about similar sanctions being applied to their own countries shall they say anything against dictate of the collective West.

Back in September some of the most reputable global investment banks stopped recommending their customers to invest in EU stocks or bonds and proposed investment in America, China and emerging countries. 

By the way, it looks like Polish prime minister is once again trying to divide bear skin while the bear is still living. 

In recent interview to Estonian media Charles Lichfield, a senior finance expert at the Atlantic Council  said that United States and its European allies are unable to locate an estimated two-thirds or more of the Russian assets that they froze in a retaliatory response to Russia's military invasion of Ukraine in February. ‚Äú They just don‚Äôt know where exactly they the frozen funds are. 

The expert furthermore added that the EU and the US had, in actual, seized $80-$100 billion and not $300 billion Russian assets as was widely reported in the American media. The EU additionally froze $16.9 billion more in addition to the freezing previous assets in the Central Bank of Russia's foreign exchange reserves around the world. 

If the U.S. does not play along It means that Brussels actually has the capacity to confiscate about 8-10 times less than envisaged, and this won‚Äôt be nearly enough to compensate their expenses and losses.

As energy prices have soared, more and more large European businesses are looking to move their industrial facilities overseas. 

The United States have longed opposed cooperation between Russia and Europe in energy sector. Inexpensive Russian pipeline gas brought European industry incredible competitive advantages that negated disadvantages of high cost of labor and high tax burden. Moreover, it enabled many European industries such as the car industry to successfully compete with American enterprises at foreign markets that the U.S. considers their own playground. 

Now Europe finally got rid of its dependence on ‚Äúnon-democratic‚Äù Russian gas, and is no longer dependent on Russia. According to recent revelations of Werner Steinecker, ex-CEO of Austrian Energie AG, EU has signed 20-year LNG supply contracts with the United States based on ‚Äútake or pay‚Äù formula that met such a harsh critics in Europe when it was used by Russia.

This means that European Union will have to pay the United States any ‚Äúmarket price‚Äù just to meet their basic demands. Costs of energy are already rising and they are not so noticeable by European consumers only because of government subsidies. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èMoreover, U.S. subsidies of their own industry may deal the last stroke to competitiveness of Europe although their long-term impact on U.S. economy is also controversial. European countries have little to do in response except for taking similar measures. 

France has proposed unrestricted subsidies to European industrial enterprises and this proposal is supported by many other EU countries with notable exception of Scandinavia that suffers less from the energy crisis. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èThe problem with industrial subsidies is that while they can give short-term boost to industry, they are not viable in long term. Subsidies can help create new industries, subsidies can help in production of critical things, but they cannot make industry competitive. 

European subsidies will effectively mean that European industry will yield losses to subsidizing countries. Competitiveness means low costs and European states will have to pay all the time to keep those costs low or face exodus of industry to other regions. This will put an end to relative wealth of the European Union.

üî¥ Is there another way? Sure, they can resume their contracts with Russia. Will Russia agree on that? Unlikely. Too many things have been said and done to make it easy. Europe will have to pay if it wants to restore ties. Russia will not come begging for mercy, but if Europe will, they still have a chance to save themselves from turning into a third world region.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1998.0,4.0,2022-12-16T11:16:16+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,48.0,MessageEntityBold,175.0,182.0,MessageEntityBold,435.0,134.0,MessageEntityBold,1146.0,367.0,MessageEntityBold,2511.0,352.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,506.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,506.0,,,,,MessageReplies,2.0,25478.0,False,[],,16775.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Latest news about U.S. supplying Patriot air defense systems to Ukraine raised a question of what else can be supplied. It is obvious that use of these systems by Ukraine before the end of next summer will mean that they are operated by NATO personnel. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èIt is very likely that these personnel will come from Poland as the country has its own Patriot batteries and trained teams capable to operate them. Other NATO countries can also provide some operators but Poland has its own interests in the region. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èPlacement of these batteries would also be interesting. It is possible that the U.S. are in fact supplying them to defend West Ukraine from Russian missile strikes as this part of the country still can eventually end up as a part of Poland, a good American puppet. 

Shortage of missiles can be overcome for a short time by sacrifice of supplies by Poland and other European countries, so it is the question of whether Europe will risk its own safety and stay defenseless for an extended period of time. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èDmitry Medvedev, vice chairman of the Russian Security Council has already stated that any supplied batteries are going to be legitimate targets for Russian forces. Considering their price, Patriot batteries are a worthy target for Russian hypersonic missiles, so strikes on them are very likely.

While these supplies are not a real threat, they may be a sign of things to come. Whatever little threat they pose, this is still an escalation by the Western side. If Russia does not respond with further escalation, NATO can view it as permission to do anything they like. 

üî∫What will come next? They might continue testing Russian resilience and bringing more challenges. If they get away with air defense batteries, nothing will stop them from sending NATO warplanes, tanks and artillery with NATO personnel operating them under the guise of ‚Äútrained Ukrainians‚Äù. 

NATO personnel will be needed for another reason ‚Äî they can soon run out of Ukrainians. Ukrainian and European officials have many times slipped out ‚Äúsecret information‚Äù that Ukrainian casualties exceed 100,000 killed and with standard killed to wounded ratio of 1:3 this means that actual Ukrainian combat casualties exceed 400,000. 

NATO can risk open collision with Russia and use Ukraine as ‚Äúplayground‚Äù to test their military in real combat against Russian Armed Forces. Will they? This is a big question and it heavily depends on responses and actions of Russia. 

Ukraine is foreign land for Europeans and Americans, they have no reasons to care about it or try to spare it. This is not the case for Russians so our objective remains the same ‚Äî liberate our lands from Nazi regime and make sure that no NATO soldier will ever tread the Ukrainian soil.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2196.0,4.0,2022-12-14T15:02:27+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,176.0,MessageEntityBold,1078.0,300.0,MessageEntityBold,1656.0,21.0,MessageEntityBold,2521.0,111.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,504.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,504.0,,,,,MessageReplies,11.0,25478.0,False,[],,16771.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As expected, the solution was found and European Commission did appease Hungarian government by unfreezing some of their own funding that was frozen on some rather vague grounds related to alignment of Hungarian anti-corruption laws with EU laws. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èSpeaking about corruption, Eva Kaili was stripped of her position as a vice chairman in the European Parliament because of alleged involvement in bribery related to the choice of Qatar as host of the World Cup. Of course, that‚Äôs not a big deal, EU can continue teach everyone else about what corruption is ü•∏

Anyway, the European Union decided to go on with its mission to support Ukraine. ‚Ç¨18 billion may be a huge sum for one person or even for a large group of people, but it‚Äôs not enough to run a country. Even if Ukraine receives this money, even if it won‚Äôt be stolen by Zelensky and his team, even if it will be used in most efficient way, it will cover just 1/3 of Ukrainian budget deficit in 2023. Not a single cent to restoration, just regular budget expenses. 

United States is also providing financial aid to Ukraine, but it‚Äôs also not unlimited. Again, if the entire $38 billion package proposed by Biden is approved, if Ukraine gets all of it, if not a single cent of it gets stolen, Ukraine has a chance to cover budget deficit in 2023‚Ä¶ unless things get worse, and that‚Äôs what they are going to get if Kiev won‚Äôt get to senses. 

However, it won‚Äôt happen as Biden‚Äôs package is mostly about military aid. U.S. is not interested in getting Ukrainian economy running, it is interested in dealing maximum damage to Russia with the hands of Ukrainians. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èOh, and there is one more interesting thing about this European aid package. This aid package is in fact a 35-year loan that Ukrainians will have to repay, and this is the case with virtually all aid packages to Ukraine. 

It‚Äôs easy to take the money but it‚Äôs hard to return them. Ukrainian national debt has doubled since August. Next year it can quadruple and virtually all remaining state income will go for interest payment. 

Creditors have frozen the debt until December 2023, but they will never write it off. Many future generations of Ukrainians will pay for stupidity and stubbornness of Kiev regime. Dreams of making Russia repay those debts will remain dreams and everyone understands it. 

Zelensky keeps asking for more and more money and weapons but he won‚Äôt get everything he wants. Banks don‚Äôt approve loans to people if their debt burden is too high and they have nothing to offer as a collateral. Dramatic shows may help in fund raising but they don‚Äôt help getting real money.

Last week was marked with escalation of Kosovo crisis in Serbia when police forces of the unrecognized republic have entered Serbian municipalities in violation of previous agreements. Local Serbian population was rightfully worried about that and created barricades to prevent the dangerous outcome.

‚ñ™Ô∏èAfter multiple discussions, official Serbian government decided to use legal methods to come to defense of Kosovo Serbs and appealed to UN resolution as well as Brussels agreements and Washington agreements filing a request to bring joint Serbian police and military forces to Serb-populated areas of the region.

However, the region is occupied by ‚Äúpeacekeeper‚Äù forces of NATO and numerous EU officials have already spoke in support of unrecognized Kosovo, which is about to submit a request for EU candidate status despite not being recognized by five countries of the EU ‚Äî Cyprus, Greece, Romania, Slovakia and Spain. 

This is undoubtedly an artificial crisis that has been created by Kosovo authorities with tacit approval or even upon request of NATO. While formalizing the secession of the criminal-ridden republic from Serbia has always been the ultimate goal of the collective West, this specific moment was chosen for a reason, and the reason is Russia. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èRussian special operation in Ukraine is running well and it does not look like Kiev regime will hold too much longer, especially if it ever gets off western life support. However, at the moment SMO draws a lot of Russian resources and other Russian capabilities are limited. 

If Serbian conflict gets escalated, and it most likely will get escalated as even very moderate Vucic cannot ignore moods in Serbian society and just acknowledge Kosovo and join anti-Russian sanctions, Russian capabilities of helping Serbia directly will be very limited.

If anything happens, Russia won‚Äôt even have an easy way to send any aid to Serbia as the country is landlocked and European air space is closed for Russian aircraft. While this aid can be dispatched through third countries, it‚Äôs still a serious restriction, especially if it is about military aid.

Seeing that Russia has turned the tide in Ukraine and its victory is just a matter of time, whatever it takes, NATO may even resort to military provocations by directly using force against Serbia and maybe exchanging Ukraine for Kosovo. 

If Russia tries sending any serious forces to Serbia, these forces will still be at huge risk and this will reduce Russian capabilities on Ukrainian front. A token force will most likely become a target of provocation, so there are really no good choices here.

However, one thing is important to remember. Russia is not charity. Last time when Russia helped Serbia, it triggered a World War, and this time such possibility is also on the table. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èSerbia is Russia-friendly country, sure, but if they want Russian help, they finally have to choose a side officially. Worth noting that Serbia voted for UN GA resolution that condemned ‚ÄúRussian attack on Ukraine‚Äù. If Serbia was an unquestionable Russian ally, things would be simple. But as it stands, maybe refraining would be a better choice.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1821.0,6.0,2022-12-14T08:19:49+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,45.0,MessageEntityBold,233.0,117.0,MessageEntityBold,666.0,309.0,MessageEntityBold,1320.0,170.0,MessageEntityBold,1597.0,273.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,499.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,499.0,,,,,MessageReplies,12.0,25478.0,False,[],,17719.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On Sunday Ukrainian president Zelensky spoke with U.S. President Joe Biden and reported that about a half of Ukrainian energy grid infrastructure has been destroyed.  

Earlier on Sunday, Ukraine‚Äôs Prime Minister Denys Shmygal said that all thermal and hydroelectric power plants across the country were damaged following ‚Äúeight waves of missile strikes.‚Äù He added that 40 percent of high-voltage power grids ‚Äúwere damaged to varying degrees.‚Äù

‚ñ™Ô∏è Zelensky allegedly asked Biden for more weapons and got his approval, but the reality is looming over him. Latest batches of U.S. aid to Ukraine are now measured in millions, not in billions and Ukrainian masters are reluctant to give away even that in face of expected audits and doubts about any serious perspectives of Ukraine. 

‚ñ™Ô∏è Lack of money is only a half of Ukrainian problem ‚Äî the main problem is that they are not able to restore energy grid as fast as Russian attacks turn it into dust. Moreover, their reserves of spares are depleted and neither Europe nor the U.S. can quickly provide it with equipment based on different standards or even with the necessary amount of generators.

Generators are becoming a next Achilles heel of the Kiev regime. According to estimates, there are about 300,000-400,000 generator sets in Ukraine. Many of them are not intended for continuous long-term operation and in either case, this amount is not even nearly enough to meet energy needs of the country. Latest batch of U.S. aid contained 300 units. Even if every Ukraine‚Äôs ‚Äúsupporter‚Äù will provide the same amount, there still won‚Äôt be enough.  

Generators, fuel, spare parts for power grid, ammunition, weapons, equipment, military hardware, air defense systems. Most of all, money. Ukraine is getting in deeper and deeper dependence on Western supplies, while those supplies are becoming more and more scarce and Ukraine‚Äôs partners are gradually losing their ability to send those supplies.

‚ñ™Ô∏è According to Ukraine, eight waves of missile strikes damaged a half of their energy infrastructure. This means that four-six more waves will completely disable it making life for Russian forces much easier. Even if Kiev regime continues its stubborn resistance with energy grid destroyed, Russia will be free to use its missiles for other critical targets and punch enemy to the state when no resistance will be possible.

As soon as old Ukrainian reserves will be fully depleted, there will be no way for the West to sustain AFU‚Äôs military operations. Immense human casualties don‚Äôt help as well. Foreign mercenaries are not that willing to fight and die for Ukraine while new recruits have really low morale and are mostly used as cannon fodder. 

Remains of professional army and neo-Nazi battalions still manage to hold recruits at the front lines, blocking detachments are still effectively preventing mass desertion and surrender. Ukrainian defense can still look strong from outside.

As time passes by, Western countries intensify their verbal support of Ukraine but weapon supplies to Ukraine are getting lower, countries of the collective West are almost out of stock and are scrapping for last bits of this and that everywhere. There are even talks of unearthing some reserves of old Soviet weapons stocked by Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi and sending these to Ukrainians. 

European countries are plunging deeper and deeper into economic crisis and the U.S. is stepping over their heads instead of stretching a helping hand to them. Controversial economic measures such as oil price caps do not help stabilization of global economy and China is securing far better deals in the Middle East than EU.

‚ùóÔ∏èThe United States have already achieved their objective to deindustrialize Europe, strip it of competitive advantage in form of cheap Russian energy and lure European capitals and companies into U.S. jurisdictions. 

It is becoming obvious that end of the Ukrainian conflict will not be the end of conflict between Russia and the West and this conflict known as Cold War 2.0. will in fact only intensify after the end of the hot phase.

üî¥ But what are the objectives of the U.S.-led collective West for this hot phase? 

There is only one big objective and only one chance for their side to win ‚Äî installing a puppet regime in Russia. Since Russia is a nuclear superpower, this cannot be done from outside, so they used several different tactical approaches to try and achieve that.

First, they wanted to shock Russia with sanctions and cripple its economy. That is why they forced Ukraine to resist from the very beginning instead of immediate surrender. 

By summer, when Russian economy has recovered from the initial shock and showed unprecedented results, the collective West to a new method ‚Äî increase military pressure. Mass supply of weapons, instructors, mercenaries and money did bring Ukraine some interim successes, however setbacks never made in impact on solidarity of Russian people with the government. 

When it turned clear that military victory is impossible, some Western politicians and military started getting around with the idea of freezing the conflict luring the Russian government into a trap of a temporary ceasefire agreement, so called ‚ÄúMinsk 3‚Äù. Russian public was indeed worried about possible ceasefire agreement on unfavorable term but Kremlin was firm in its position to fulfil all SMO objectives. 

‚ùóÔ∏èIn fact, this uncertainty could last much longer, but Angela Merkel did a big service to Russia by revealing the true intention of previous Minsk Agreements ‚Äî to win time and militarize Ukraine. Vladimir Putin expressed doubts on whether it is possible to achieve any agreements and what would guarantee them although said that some agreement is eventually inevitable.

The collective West failed to achieve quick victory and incite a regime change in Russia. They may resort to more plans but their support heavily depends on situation on the ground and their own capabilities, which are dwindling day after day. 

Russian tactics is working and there are many signs showing that Ukrainian state is close to collapse.

On Friday, December 9th, Tengrinews.kz reported the Kazakhstan Agency of Regulation and Development of Financial Market has proudly stated that Kazakhstan‚Äôs banks have obtained OFAC permission to perform transactions with MIR payment cards.

On December 8th, Kazakhstan‚Äôs regulatory agency has received a letter from the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) of the U.S. Department of the Treasury where it stated that it does not object against use of Mir cards by private persons, specifically citizens that have migrated from Russia to Kazakhstan, for personal needs. The letter also states that all Mir transactions will be still subject to special control.

The agency organized a meeting with representatives of Kazakhstan‚Äôs banks to explain the specifics of Mir system usage. Kazakhstan‚Äôs banks can accept payments and wire transfers over Mir cards and issue cash through ATMs. The banks can decide whether they want to use Mir or not.

Those ‚Äúpositive‚Äù news don‚Äôt really look positive. First of all, they raise a lot of questions about Kazakhstan‚Äôs regulatory system. It is unclear whether Kazakhstan Agency of Regulation and Development is also a division of U.S. Treasury Department as they need its permissions for internal regulations. 

Besides, this easement is not aimed to support Mir system. It is a common knowledge that a large number of Russian draft dodgers have found refuge in Kazakhstan. Of course, people of Kazakhstan are not especially happy with this influx, but it is not about them. It‚Äôs about the U.S. showing their support for those migrants thus indirectly stimulating further migration from Russia. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èOf course, Kazakhstan is a friend and partner of the Russian Federation. Moscow was the first place where Tokayev went after his re-election a few weeks ago. Kazakhstan plays an important role in Eurasian Union and in transit of goods from China to Russia. 

However, the influence of U.S. and Europe in Kazakhstan is also very high. Oil industry is largely controlled by foreign investors, just as many other industries of Kazakhstan. Unlike Russia, Kazakhstan cannot afford breaking ties and falling under sanctions, so they do have to be cautious.

Nonetheless, the very fact that they are talking about ‚Äúpermission‚Äù means they accept the authority of OFAC and U.S. Treasury Department being above the authority of national law. 

General attitude of Kazakhstan‚Äôs people to Russian SMO is not so positive and is gradually changing to negative. Maybe this has to do with exposure to foreign propaganda, maybe this has to do with slow progress of SMO, maybe this has to do with those draft dodgers, but the fact is that SMO support has halved in March. 

üü• Russia has to pay closer attention to situation in Kazakhstan and maybe be a bit more active in promoting itself. This doesn‚Äôt just mean helping Tokaev and providing benefits to Kazakhstan. This didn‚Äôt work in Ukraine. Explaining Russian point of view to people of Kazakhstan is the best way to prevent a color revolution and to counter influence of U.S. NGOs that are still running loose in this Central Asian republic.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,6443.0,14.0,2022-12-10T08:14:12+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,87.0,MessageEntityUrl,90.0,13.0,MessageEntityBold,90.0,13.0,MessageEntityBold,103.0,204.0,MessageEntityBold,729.0,281.0,MessageEntityBold,1060.0,80.0,MessageEntityBold,1316.0,57.0,MessageEntityBold,1701.0,436.0,MessageEntityBold,2759.0,116.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,493.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,493.0,,,,,MessageReplies,4.0,25478.0,False,[],,16687.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of course, exact change of image depends on which part of the world you will ask. Brainwashed Western and non-Western people following global media see Russians as some non-human savages that are coming to destroy civilization. They are mostly people who know little or nothing about Russia and their view is the result of deliberate propaganda campaigns aimed to dehumanize Russian people and present Russia as some kind of alien threat. 

‚ùóÔ∏èThese campaigns started long before the special military operation and in fact date back several centuries. Thanks to Russian unique religious and cultural traditions, its unique set of value, it has been viewed by the Western Europe as some barbaric state ever since Russian liberation from the Mongol yoke.

Those Western people who have critical thinking abilities see Russia as a powerful country that shouldn‚Äôt be messed with. Especially using such shameless ways as closing eyes to Nazification of Ukraine and pushing it to fight. They know history, they know at least something of Russian culture and traditions and they do respect Russia even if they don‚Äôt support it.

As for the rest of the world, they admire Russian bravery, since Russia was brave enough to challenge NATO, and isn‚Äôt going to fall back. Numerous countries humiliated by the United States have dreamed for decades about someone fighting them back. 

Serbia, Iran, Cuba, Venezuela, Syria‚Ä¶ this is just the list of most prominent victims of the U.S. and their military. Virtually all countries of the Third World have suffered from American intervention, be it direct military attack, installation of puppet government, support of rebels, attempts of economic domination ‚Äì U.S. aggression has many forms.

The Western mass media machine is doing everything it can to brainwash people of the West and the rest of the world. It works to an extent, but they cannot hide the fact that 3/4 of the world (by both population and territory) leans to Russia in this conflict. 

And even this media machine is beginning to fail. RT‚Äôs Margarita Simonyan has just shared a story about the Insider* (foreign agent media in Russia) being worried about increased coverage of ‚ÄúRussian propaganda‚Äù stating that 44% of Germans fully or partially agree that ‚ÄúVladimir Putin fights global elites that secretly run the world‚Äù. 

They have to concede that Russian channels are still popular and that their blocks of main Russian media outlets have just resulted in creation of many small Telegram channels and chats that share links to each other and spread the Russian narrative. Even YouTube can‚Äôt continuously track and delete numerous unofficial channels spreading real news from Russia. 

Of course, victory in information war is still a distant prospect. Russia needs more official outlets and channels to reach the global audience. Covering not just the West, but the entire world. RT is a successful case, but Russia needs dozens of such outlets to influence global information space on the same scale the West does. A first good step would be supporting those numerous small outlets that are telling truth to the world.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1855.0,9.0,2022-12-08T15:04:09+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,347.0,MessageEntityBold,566.0,106.0,MessageEntityBold,1244.0,136.0,MessageEntityBold,1532.0,78.0,MessageEntityBold,2161.0,289.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,487.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,487.0,,,,,MessageReplies,7.0,25478.0,False,[],,16601.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notwithstanding cold temperatures below -20 ¬∞C, Mongolia is facing quite serious public protests with people accusing the government of corruption in coal trade. Protesters have marched into the center of the capital and are trying to break into administrative buildings including the State Palace.

üü• Officially the reason for unrest was about tens millions tons of coal worth billions of dollars gone missing. Over eighty percent of Mongolian export goes to China and coal constitutes about a quarter of that export, so this is an important part of the state budget.

The corruption story was very real and was in fact uncovered on Chinese end. According to some reports, China has responded to the matter very harshly and the guilty officials were executed, while Mongolia was given the names of its own politicians involved in the criminal scheme. However, government‚Äôs response was very soft and this made Mongolian people unhappy as it looked like the corrupt officials got away with the amount comparable to country‚Äôs annual budget.

üü• Mongolia has already seen public unrest in April when protesters issued demands to fight inflation, eliminate corruption and improve quality of life as Ukrainian crisis resulted in some economical problems for the country. 

For now, Mongolian government has not imposed a state of emergency and it is likely that protests will not expand. While European media outlets are doing their best to fuel them up, they don‚Äôt have the influence and cannot offer protesters any good alternatives. 

üü• Publications such as Bloomberg vouch for privatization of the remaining part of Mongolian coal industry that will allegedly prevent corruption. A large part of Mongolian natural resources is already controlled by foreigners, for example international Rio Tinto group controls the entire copper export of the country. 

While corruption is bad and should definitely punished, conceding natural resources to foreigners doesn‚Äôt mean that Mongolia will get more money. In fact, it will just mean extra profits for international conglomerates that are already enjoying profits from a good part of Mongolian natural riches.

‚¨õÔ∏è For Russia Mongolia remains an important country and a partner as well as a long-term buyer of Russian energy as Russia provides for virtually all energy needs of the steppe country. One more important thing about Mongolia is that it was supposed to become a transit country as one of the branches of Siberian Power 2 pipeline will go to China through Ulan-Bator over almost a 1000 km of Mongolian territory. 

While interference in Mongolia is undesirable for Russia, there is a need to watch for signs of color revolution as both spring protests and current unrest have some indications of foreign support. This is especially noticeable now as the objective of protesters attacks on government buildings is unclear.

As the collective West has successfully hindered export of Russian energy in western direction, the eastern direction becomes more important and Mongolia could become a weak point and the next target for regime change.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1745.0,1.0,2022-12-07T15:32:18+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,23.0,MessageEntityBold,185.0,138.0,MessageEntityBold,325.0,109.0,MessageEntityBold,594.0,76.0,MessageEntityBold,1068.0,225.0,MessageEntityBold,1561.0,142.0,MessageEntityBold,2183.0,181.0,MessageEntityBold,2594.0,196.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,484.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,484.0,,,,,MessageReplies,2.0,25478.0,False,[],,16583.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

‚è±  According to latest reports, this Tuesday the Hungarian government has blocked agreement on an ‚Ç¨18 billion aid package for Ukraine, forcing the European Commission and the other EU countries to seek an alternative solution to ensure Kiev gets its funds in January.

The Commission will look at how to ""provide the necessary solution to Ukraine already as of January,"" EU Budget Commissioner Johannes Hahn said during a public session of the bloc's finance ministers. This would entail something akin to so-called enhanced cooperation, a legal pathway to avoid vetoes, EU officials said.

Of course, it is more a symbolical gesture by Hungary and it is probably related more to Orban‚Äôs desire to unfreeze some multi-billion grants by EU in return for his approval. 

‚ñ™Ô∏è Hungary is by no means an ally of Russia, but it looks like one of the most reasonable countries in EU and it obviously knows more about real face of Ukraine than others because Ukrainian nationalists treat Hungarian-speaking minorities in Transcarpathia similarly to Russian speakers. 

For now, Hungary is acting alone, however the general Ukraine fatigue is becoming noticeable elsewhere in Europe. Recent statements of Olaf Scholz and Emmanuel Macron about the need to consider Russian interests in European security framework show that they are slowly changing their rhetoric or rather that they feel the need to change it because of pressure from their people and the opposition.

‚ùóÔ∏èThe fate of European ‚Ç¨18 billion aid package to Ukraine will probably be decided next week on another meeting of EU ministers of finances. It‚Äôs too early to expect miracles or think that EU will go against the will of the United States. 

However, it this aid is becoming a subject of EU internal games and this may mean that Ukraine is getting less and less relevant by itself but matters only as a nuisance and a drain for battered European budget.

Czechia, which is chairing the Council of the European Union, will surely continue its Russophobe politics and will champion aid to Ukraine for as long as it takes. Although this position is rather symbolic, it does give the Council President country some extra visibility and more opportunities to promote its initiatives.

‚è± In January this position will go to Sweden, which is a bit more moderate than East European Russophobes but is still likely to continue their policies about Ukraine. Spain‚Äôs presidency in second half of 2023 offers more opportunities. 

Anyway, Russia should definitely use any possible shortages and windfalls in Western support of Ukraine to increase its own pressure and show the European Union and their American ‚Äúpartners‚Äù that this aid will not bring them any dividends but will only extend the bloodshed.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1698.0,3.0,2022-12-07T11:43:51+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,308.0,MessageEntityBold,345.0,67.0,MessageEntityBold,814.0,102.0,MessageEntityBold,1102.0,114.0,MessageEntityBold,1501.0,140.0,MessageEntityBold,2282.0,42.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,483.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,483.0,,,,,MessageReplies,3.0,25478.0,False,[],,16579.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Russian government has already announced that it is not going to deal with any states that will implement the price cap and that response will follow.

‚ÄúThis price cap has three objectives: First, it strengthens the effect of our sanctions. Second, it will further diminish Russia‚Äôs revenues, and thirdly, at the same time, it will stabilize global energy markets,‚Äù said Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission.

üü• Will the price cap achieve those three objectives? 

The first objective is a like dual-edged sword. Yes, the price cap will strengthen the effect of sanctions. It may have some negative effect on Russia, but it will also have equal or greater negative effect on the European Union itself as one of the main consumers of oil in the world. 

The second objective will probably be achieved. Yes, Russia will lose some of its revenues. While Russia will surely sell resources to partners at higher prices, the whole process will be made harder and more expensive. Since these sanctions are also applied to transportation of Russian oil, they will bring up transportation costs and will possibly force Russia to give discounts or sell oil with delivery at port. 

On the other hand, it will stimulate further development of Russian petrochemical industry and refineries. Why sell crude oil if we can sell plastic to our Chinese neighbors who always need it.

The third objective is not from the realm of common sense. If anything, this decision will create turmoil at the global energy market and drive the prices up. Price regulation attempts have never ended well on either side. Russia has the support of OPEC+ and OPEC+ does not like the idea of anyone setting caps that can limit their own revenues.

Price cap on Russian oil can be followed by price cap on Saudi oil ‚Äî they have a history of human rights violation and are involved in Yemen war. It can even be followed by a price cap on Qatar oil ‚Äî the West accuses Qatar of corruption in securing FIFA World Cup and of course in violation of LGBTQ rights.

For now, OPEC decided to keep everything as is. No increase of production to cover potential deficit. This won‚Äôt bring any changes right away, but next year forecasts speak about oil price rising way above $100 even if we don‚Äôt take inflation into account. 

However, OPEC is not on the side of collective West and can yet say their word. In 1970s the world was much less dependent on oil supplies but Arab countries managed to create immense global crisis that caused a decade long period of double-digit USD inflation. This time the situation is very different as there are customers outside the collective West.

üü• Maybe OPEC countries also remember that only two countries did not join the oil embargo in 1970s. Iraq and Lybia. Their fate shows what gratitude of the West is really worth.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1736.0,3.0,2022-12-06T09:33:11+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,83.0,MessageEntityBold,213.0,242.0,MessageEntityBold,521.0,56.0,MessageEntityBold,685.0,180.0,MessageEntityBold,957.0,126.0,MessageEntityBold,1538.0,98.0,MessageEntityBold,1826.0,309.0,MessageEntityBold,2237.0,157.0,MessageEntityBold,2751.0,177.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,480.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,480.0,,,,,MessageReplies,1.0,25478.0,False,[],,16552.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Easy border control, simple migration procedures and prevalence of Russian language played a big role in its popularity among those Russians who decided to relocate for various reasons.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è There are several distinct types of Russian ‚Äúemigrants‚Äù in Kazakhstan.

The first wave came in spring and mainly consisted of two types of people ‚Äî so-called ‚Äúliberals‚Äù who disagreed with special operation of Russian Armed Forces in Ukraine and a number of IT specialists who were working in international projects and had problems with getting payments and being engaged international collaboration due to sanctions.

‚ùóÔ∏èMost ‚Äúliberals‚Äù didn‚Äôt stay in Kazakhstan for long but just used it as a transit point in their journey to ‚Äúcivilized world‚Äù. Locals noticed their arrogance, disregard to local customs and traditions and bloated self-esteem. 

Some IT specialists did stay in Kazakhstan. Many have registered their companies in tax-free zones such as the one in Astana. These companies are often subsidiaries of Russian companies and still have ties with Russia. Many of those specialists have returned to Russia after setting up the infrastructure to circumvent sanctions. 

Some have found jobs in Kazakhstan‚Äôs IT sector although the income level was quite frustrating as compared to Russia. Yet another group of IT specialists, so-called ‚Äúdigital nomads‚Äù working mainly for Western customers, have also moved on to Europe or Asia.

The second wave of migration came in autumn and it contained quite different type of people. If liberals can be considered ‚Äúideological immigrants‚Äù and IT guys are out for the money, September and October were the time of draft dodgers.

Local people have made their distinction and this includes Russians living in Kazakhstan. Nobody is happy about draft dodgers. Many of them are just living on charity and begging for money and shelter at railway stations, few are ready to work for Kazakhstan‚Äôs salary and most of them are planning to return. 

ü™ñ Attitude of Kazakhstan people to SMO is mixed, both among Russians and among Kazakhs. However, all of them share contempt to healthy males running away from their duty, not willing to work and just drinking there time around. 

This influx brought side effects in form of increased costs of living ‚Äî prices for apartment renting have increased by two times or more since the beginning of summer. Students have trouble finding any affordable housing to rent.

It's only a matter of time when draft dodgers will start returning to Russia. While the government probably won‚Äôt implement any repressions against those people, they should not hope that attitude to them at home will be better than in neighboring country.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1931.0,4.0,2022-12-05T14:23:59+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,719.0,MessageEntityBold,991.0,81.0,MessageEntityBold,1398.0,141.0,MessageEntityBold,1721.0,56.0,MessageEntityBold,1867.0,35.0,MessageEntityBold,2319.0,69.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,479.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,479.0,,,,,MessageReplies,4.0,25478.0,False,[],,16560.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

9Ô∏è‚É£ Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy. 

‚ÄúFor Ur-Fascism there is no struggle for life but, rather, life is lived for struggle.‚Äù

Absolutely. Any calls for peace in modern Ukraine are a sign of treason. The great Fuhrer Zelensky said that there will be no negotiations, no peace talks with Russia. Anyone expressing doubt in victory of the great Ukraine ends in prison or force conscripted.

1Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ Contempt for the weak. 

‚ÄúElitism is a typical aspect of any reactionary ideology.‚Äù

Adepts of Ukrainian regime definitely consider themselves being above other people. Their cause is right, their words are impeccable, their well-being is of utmost importance. Their words about Ukrainians being ready to suffer for years to join the European Union shows unprecedented level of their contempt against common people.

1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Everybody is educated to become a hero. 

‚ÄúIn Ur-Fascist ideology, heroism is the norm. This cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult of death.‚Äù

While modern Ukraine has a certain deficit of heroes, this is still a part of Ukrainian national ideology. 

Glory to heroes, all that. Those heroes are just a bit‚Ä¶ specific.

1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Machismo and weaponry. 

‚ÄúMachismo implies both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality.‚Äù

This is one of the few features doesn‚Äôt openly manifest in modern Ukraine. However, private talks and even online publications of Ukrainian nationalists show that the government‚Äôs support of pride parades and other ‚Äúmodern trends‚Äù are meant just for a show. 

As for the cult of weapons, it got really widespread, promoted by Ukrainian president continuously posing in some military-style clothing.

1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ Selective populism. 

‚ÄúThere is in our future a TV or Internet populism, in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the People.‚Äù

That feature is absolutely present in modern Ukraine. Zelensky understands everything about manipulating the public and knows how to create a picture that will touch the audience. 

Tragic suffering for Western public, heroic victories for locals ‚Äî with modern technologies and full information support Kiev is surely able to create compelling narrative.

1Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ Ur-Fascism speaks Newspeak. 

‚ÄúAll the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary, and an elementary syntax, in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical reasoning.‚Äù

Simple as is. With prohibition of Russian language and Russian schoolbooks, the entire education system is under full control of nationalist ideologies. They don‚Äôt need complex thinking, they just create a picture and recruit vulnerable young minds to their cause.

Here we can see that all common features of fascism are present in modern Ukraine to lesser or greater degree. When we speak about ‚ÄúUkrainian regime‚Äù or ‚ÄúUkrainian fascists‚Äù, it‚Äôs not just a label, but a reality. Western community largely dismissed Russian objective about denazification of Ukraine, which actually makes them fascist accomplices. There is nothing new about it, Europe has a history of appeasing fascists and tacit approval of their activities.

Fortunately, Ukraine is nowhere near the Third Reich and its main threat is about their support by the collective West. Arming a fascist state with modern weapons never ended well and history shows that. 

However, history may repeat. In 1930s the United States were rearming Germany but just in a few years they changed their mind. Now they are arming Ukraine, but who knows what happens tomorrow.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2008.0,15.0,2022-12-04T14:54:32+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,119.0,MessageEntityBold,124.0,40.0,MessageEntityBold,524.0,23.0,MessageEntityBold,948.0,40.0,MessageEntityBold,1285.0,23.0,MessageEntityBold,1855.0,20.0,MessageEntityBold,2415.0,28.0,MessageEntityBold,3554.0,27.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,477.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,477.0,,,,,MessageReplies,7.0,25478.0,False,[],,16588.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5Ô∏è‚É£ Fear of difference. 

‚ÄúThe first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an appeal against the intruders. Thus Ur-Fascism is racist by definition.‚Äù

National identity of modern Ukrainian nationalist has one sole ground ‚Äî proclaiming that they are not Russians. Persecution of Russian language and people identifying as Russians and their forced ukrainization is just a tip of an iceberg. Most other national minorities in Ukraine are in no better position, while remaining exceptions are used just as a token to show the Western society ‚Äî Ukrainians are no Nazis. 

Kiev regime openly proclaims superiority of Ukrainian nations, calls for genocide or ukrainization of Russian speakers, prohibits education of Russian people in Russian language. They fear Russian culture, they fear Russian language, they fear the real roots of Ukraine.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Appeal to social frustration. 

‚ÄúOne of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class, a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups.‚Äù

Ukrainian society has different division with a few oligarchs, small middle class and large masses of people that cannot be classified as such. Small Ukrainian middle class does not actually share the state ideology, so the regime is instead appealing to poor categories of people and lures them with promises and pictures of happy life in European small towns. 

Kiev regime justifies hunger, deprivations, life below poverty line by talks about bright future of the country in European Union and while these talks have been going on for many years, Ukraine did not make a single real step towards achieving this dream they imposed over Ukrainian people.

7Ô∏è‚É£ The obsession with a plot. 

‚ÄúThus at the root of the Ur-Fascist psychology there is the obsession with a plot, possibly an international one. The followers must feel besieged.‚Äù

Naturally. All Ukrainian problems are not caused by incompetent government, greedy oligarchs and Western patrons draining every last bit of Ukrainian resources. Of course not. Kiev regime will tell you that 24 hours a day. All Ukrainian troubles are a result of Russian plot, it‚Äôs Putin‚Äôs mastermind plan to drive Ukraine into poverty. Why would Russians and Putin want it? See No. 3. No questions. 

8Ô∏è‚É£ The enemy is both strong and weak. 

‚ÄúBy a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.‚Äù

This narrative has been continuously spread not just by Ukraine but by the entire collective West both before and after 2022 and SMO. Of course, the main enemy is Russia. 

Russia is strong, it threatens poor Ukraine, give us money. At the same time it‚Äôs just a backward country without any serious weapons. 

Russian barbarians have invaded Ukraine and heroic Ukrainian army barely holds their defense against them, so please send them more weapons and money. Russian missile strikes are devastating Ukraine, and Zelensky urgently needs one trillion dollars to rebuild. At the same time, Russians have lost many hundred thousand soldiers and all their equipment and are now sending untrained children and old men armed with pitchforks.

‚è± Back in 1995 famous Italian writer, philosopher and scientist Umberto Eco wrote a large essay that he titled ‚ÄúUr-Fascism‚Äù or ‚ÄúEternal Fascism‚Äù. This essay tells of his own experience of living in fascist Italy as a child and a lot of his thoughts on the fascist ideology, its roots and its signs. 

Umberto Eco defined 14 typical features indicating a fascist regime. Some of them are overlapping, some are contradicting each other, but according to him even one such sign is already a reason to worry while a combination of multiple signs makes it almost certain that a country has embraced fascist ideology. 

In this short series we are going to review those typical features of fascism and look how they apply to regime that has been running the state of Ukraine since March 2014. Let‚Äôs start from the beginning.

1Ô∏è‚É£ The cult of tradition. 

‚ÄúOne has only to look at the syllabus of every fascist movement to find the major traditionalist thinkers. The Nazi gnosis was nourished by traditionalist, syncretistic, occult elements.‚Äù

Modern Ukraine absolutely matches this criterion. When they lack real traditions, adepts of Ukrainian regime are resorting to falsification of history. The entire myth of Ukraine as an ancient state, its alienation from its Slavic roots and denial of its ties with Russia are perfect examples of replacing real national traditions with made-up. 

Symbolism and occult elements are also widely spread in modern Ukraine. Numerous terrorist battalions are openly using symbols of the Third Reich and Bandera‚Äôs OUN-UPA mirroring German symbols and expanding with their own. Many members of these battalions are practicing Paganism and occultism and have tattoos with occult symbols. 

2Ô∏è‚É£ The rejection of modernism. 

‚ÄúThe Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, is seen as the beginning of modern depravity. In this sense Ur-Fascism can be defined as irrationalism.‚Äù

This criterion does not fully apply to state-promoted ideology of Ukraine, however it is widely shared by most Ukrainian patriots. Neanderthal way of thinking is very common among Ukrainian patriots and hides under the disguise of ‚Äútolerance‚Äù and ‚Äúmodern values‚Äù used by Kiev regime to fool its Western patrons and extort money from them. Ironically, current degradation of Ukrainian industry may lead them to their desired rural idyllic. 

3Ô∏è‚É£ The cult of action for action‚Äôs sake. 

‚ÄúAction being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, any previous reflection. Thinking is a form of emasculation.‚Äù

This is a typical feature of Ukraine, and not just in last eight years. Had Ukrainian people resorted to rational thinking, they would not have their numerous maidans, they would not destroy their own industry and economy, they would not severe ties with the only country that really cared of them.

The government actively promotes this cult of action and discourages critical thinking. Ukraine is Europe, that‚Äôs it. No need to think about the costs. 

4Ô∏è‚É£ Disagreement is treason. 

‚ÄúThe critical spirit makes distinctions, and to distinguish is a sign of modernism. In modern culture the scientific community praises disagreement as a way to improve knowledge.‚Äù

Ever since 2014, Kiev regime has pursued this principle. They banned political parties, they persecuted activists speaking against their agenda, they ignored terror and murders of dissidents committed by nationalist battalions and groups like the Right Sector. Crimes against those disagreeing were left unpunished, while even token violations by dissidents were punished with harshest measures.

This initiative serves two objectives. 

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Firstly, this is yet another step of methodical process of framing and villainizing Russia and Russian people. It will use all fakes, unverified rumors and claims of Kiev regime as ‚Äúfactual evidence‚Äù and will likely blame Russia of all imaginable and unimaginable sins. Maybe they will even declare Russia innocent of some minor violations or debunk some fakes to gain credibility. 

This objective is important for European Council to keep brainwashing people of Europe and legitimize their own crimes against Russia (on that later). They need to explain Europeans that only Ukraine protects them from ‚ÄúRussian hordes‚Äù and they will create a vivid picture that will scare the hell out of common EU citizens making them happy to tolerate some ‚Äúinconvenience‚Äù and forget economic crisis to fight the ‚Äúuniversal evil‚Äù. 

‚ñ∂Ô∏è The second objective is much more trivial. Europe still pretends to live by the rule of law and is still looking for pretext to confiscate frozen Russian assets stored in its jurisdiction. The process has already started with recent proposal of EU President von der Leyen to create ‚Äúa structure to manage these funds and invest them‚Äù. 

‚ùóÔ∏èStarting from the beginning of the special operation, Western countries have blocked about $300 billion reserves of Russian Central Bank and about $20 billion in assets owned by private individuals. Freezing itself is a gross violation of all international laws and treaties and greatly undermined trust of the entire world in the collective West. However, confiscation would constitute even a greater transgression.

Therefore, Europe and the collective West needs some means to legitimize seizure or, plainly speaking, theft of Russian assets and the proposed ‚Äútribunal‚Äù is going to serve exactly that purpose. They will establish arbitrary assessment of damage and voila, Ukraine will get the money. 

But that‚Äôs just what Ukraine thinks. As we have numerously noted, European Union is undergoing deep economic crisis and there are strong signs of its coming deindustrialization with European companies moving production to China and even the United States. So, this money is more likely to cover a big hole in EU pockets that appeared due to ‚Äúaid to Ukraine‚Äù, which of course was not ‚Äúfree‚Äù. Naturally, Zelensky and his team will get their cut to enjoy retirement in some sunny place 

All this is nice, but they forgot one thing ‚Äî time for tribunals comes after victory. Russia does not acknowledge this tribunal, so instead of legitimizing EU actions it will delegitimize them and undermine global trust in the collective West even further. 

It‚Äôs a bit strange that this gesture came from France, which was one of the least Russophobe countries on the European continent and has its own opinion about Ukrainian conflict. President Macron reverberates the narrative of the collective West but he also has to listen to his people and it‚Äôs not an accident that many French companies are still operating in Russia.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2177.0,5.0,2022-12-02T11:09:04+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,2.0,254.0,MessageEntityBold,268.0,100.0,MessageEntityBold,440.0,18.0,MessageEntityUnderline,777.0,15.0,MessageEntityBold,861.0,17.0,MessageEntityBold,1002.0,15.0,MessageEntityBold,1058.0,16.0,MessageEntityBold,1124.0,144.0,MessageEntityBold,1363.0,51.0,MessageEntityBold,1510.0,13.0,MessageEntityBold,1566.0,12.0,MessageEntityBold,1768.0,70.0,MessageEntityBold,2610.0,259.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,473.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,473.0,,,,,MessageReplies,7.0,25478.0,False,[],,16515.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The collective West actively condemns Russia for attacks on dual-purpose infrastructure and ignores the fact that all those attacks can be easily stopped by Ukrainian side accepting Russian terms. 

It looks like they have forgotten not so distant past when NATO itself was waging a war in Europe using this kind of tactics from the very beginning. Here is an excerpt from the transcript of NATO Press Conference dated May 25, 1999.

‚Ä¢ Norwegian News Agency: I am sorry Jamie but if you say that the Army has a lot of back-up generators, why are you depriving 70% of the country of not only electricity, but also water supply, if he has so much back-up electricity that he can use because you say you are only targeting military targets?

‚Ä¢ Jamie Shea, NATO spokesman: Yes, I'm afraid electricity also drives command and control systems. If President Milosevic really wants all of his population to have water and electricity all he has to do is accept NATO's five conditions and we will stop this campaign. But as long as he doesn't do so we will continue to attack those targets which provide the electricity for his armed forces. If that has civilian consequences, it's for him to deal with but that water, that electricity is turned back on for the people of Serbia. Unfortunately, it has been turned off for good or at least for a long, long time for all of those 1.6 million Kosovar Albanians who have been driven from their homes and who have suffered, not inconvenience, but suffered in many cases permanent damage to their lives. Now that may not be a distinction that everybody likes but for me that distinction is fundamental.

‚è± In 1999, NATO was doing exactly the same thing that Russia is doing and they were doing it from the very beginning of that campaign. At least, back then they were a bit less hypocritical and openly spoke of their objectives and things they were doing. Now they would probably say that it‚Äôs Milosevic shelling his own energy infrastructure.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è So what changes, if we replace Serbia with Ukraine and Milosevic with Zelensky? The reasoning is the same and the Kosovo precedent is sufficient to refute any accusations that NATO hypocrites are spitting at Russia. 

When Kiev regime was cutting off electricity to Crimea, when they stopped water supply to the peninsula, when they were continuously shelling Donbass destroying a large part of its infrastructure, did they care about millions of people living there? 

Using their own words, people of Donbass and Crimea have suffered in many cases permanent damage to their lives, millions of people had to escape from Donbass to Russia just to survive. Those Ukrainians that are now suffering difficulties failed to understand what Crimean and Donetsk people had to go through with their silent approval. 

‚è± Back then, Milosevic chose to spare his people and accepted NATO‚Äôs conditions although his army was still intact and able to fight. It was a hard choice but he did make it. 

However, it is unlikely that Vladimir Zelensky will follow the example. He is not an independent statesman looking for the good of his country but just a western puppet with hollow soul. He will sacrifice all Ukrainians without blinking an eye and will do anything to avoid justice and rightful retribution.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2097.0,10.0,2022-12-01T12:24:20+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,2.0,250.0,MessageEntityBold,686.0,24.0,MessageEntityBold,991.0,29.0,MessageEntityBold,1893.0,7.0,MessageEntityBold,2234.0,82.0,MessageEntityBold,2455.0,252.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,472.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,472.0,,,,,MessageReplies,5.0,25478.0,False,[],,16433.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Meanwhile more and more challenges are looming for the U.S. on the horizon with the main challenge being the People‚Äôs Republic of China. 

Media of the collective West have broadly covered recent unrest in China aimed to cancel lockdowns and zero COVID tolerance policies. Moreover, BBC has been directly involved in the protests with its journalists directly participating in them and arrested by the police. 

‚ùóÔ∏èAccording to official Chinese position, these protests were staged by external forces as the police found methodical guidelines written in Traditional Chinese, which is mainly used in Hongkong and Taiwan, while mainland China used simplified Chinese. 

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Despite broad coverage of minor protests that greatly resembled some of unsanctioned protests in Russia, Western media conveniently ignored a much more important event for China ‚Äî Taiwan elections that resulted in separatists losing power. This outcome effectively breaks the U.S. strategy to alienate Taiwan from China and keep using the island as one of its main bases in Asia Pacific region. 

There are some indications that with failure to undermine Chinese government on the mainland some forces in the United States consider starting a color revolution in Taiwan in the last attempt to stop transformation of China to global superpower number one.

‚ùóÔ∏èIndeed, China has already become top economy of the world and with its gradual drift to Russia it is bound to become the most dangerous challenger that the U.S. have ever faced. As for Chinese Armed Forces, they are already getting on par with USAF and even their nuclear arsenal is allegedly set to increase to at least 1500 warheads, according to recent Pentagon report. 

Events like todays joint patrol mission of Russian and Chinese strategic bombers show that relations between Russia and China are as cordial as ever and even imply existence of an informal military alliance between the two great powers. 

‚ñ∂Ô∏è According to the above quoted report, China is likely to create PLA logistics facilities if not full-scale bases at such countries as Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, UAE, Kenya, Seychelles, Equatorial Guinea, Tanzania, Angola, Tajikistan, Namibia, Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands. Of course, this is not yet a match for U.S. global network of military bases but a very solid breakthrough for China that will start with the first small step ‚Äî Ream Naval Base in Cambodia

Naturally, the U.S. needs both financial resources and physical arms to continue its policy of China containment and Ukrainian conflict consumes too much of those. U.S. elites know and understand that very well.

ü§î This statement makes perfect sense as Poland is one of the most involved countries in the Ukrainian conflicts. According to intelligence, Polish mercenaries are present in AFU in large numbers, and this is confirmed by reports from the battlefields on large casualties among them. 

Ukraine has already granted Poland preferred status by enacting law ""On legal and social guarantees for citizens of the Republic of Poland located at the territory of Ukraine‚Äù that effectively grants Poles all rights and freedoms as if they were citizens of Ukraine.

‚è± Galicia-Volynhia has been a part of Polish state for many centuries ever since it was occupied after withdrawal of Mongols from the area. After dissolution of Polish state in the 18th century this area went to control of Austro-Hungarian Empire and returned to Poland after the end of WW1. USSR took lands of Western Ukraine from Poland at the times of World War 2 and after the war Poland was granted a large chunk of East Prussia from Germany as compensation for keeping them as a part of Ukrainian SSR. 

Naturally, Poland has not yet forgotten and abandoned their claims and have considered their return ever since the beginning of Ukrainian conflict. As Ukrainian war effort is dwindling and the country is getting closer to collapse day after day, Polish government seems to consider their options. 

Polish society is somewhat split on the issue and in fact this expansion is not supported by majority. Economic situation in the country is getting dire with growing prices and millions of Poles finding themselves below the poverty line. The experience of contact with refugees from Ukraine is also not making Poles eager to add new territories with new citizens. Besides, they are definitely not fond of Bandera ideology.

However, the window of opportunity may close pretty soon. 2023 elections will likely see the currently ruling party ‚ÄúRight and justice‚Äù of famous Russophobe Jaroslaw Kachinsky losing power to ‚ÄúCivil coalition‚Äù of Donald Tusk. Only some great achievement such as expansion of Poland can make Poles forget about reduced quality of life and grim prospects on the future resulting from Polish pledge to support Kiev regime. 

‚ùóÔ∏èMoreover, since the survival of Ukrainian state depends solely on continuous flows of money and weapons coming from the U.S. and to lesser extent Europe, abrupt termination or even reduction of these flows may cause untimely collapse of Ukrainian state before Poland gets a chance to press its claims. 

ü§î Will West Ukrainians agree with that? No doubt, especially this will mean automatic EU citizenship for them. It looks like Kiev regime is also considering this option a viable opportunity.

‚ûñUkrainian operation for the West is slowly and steadily moving to its final stage. Apologists of Ukraine has been promoting and praising Kiev regime for years before the SMO with the aim to whitewash it and deny all its flaws and all its crimes. 
Overall Western approach to the Ukrainian problem closely resembles the process of accepting reality after shock ‚Äî denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance. 

üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èFirst stage of coping with a problem is denial. The West has been continuously denying any flaws of Ukraine and its government ever since the coup of 2014 while the previous government was blamed for all imaginable and unimaginable sins. 
The West has been continuously denying the possibility of Ukrainian surrender, the possibility of Ukrainian military defeat and the possibility of regime change in Ukraine. 

üò°Next stage is anger. This stage came this year fueled by virtually all English-language media in an unprecedented propaganda campaign resulting in half of European population really thinking that Russians are some orcs that are assaulting them (not Ukraine) with the objective to destroy civilization.
Western anger manifested in sanctions, supplies of arms and continuous endorsement of Kiev regime in its crazy wet dreams of overcoming Russia.

üí∞ Now we are on the stage of bargaining. Western powers have realized that their plan to cripple Russia with sanctions did not work and that all slander attempts didn‚Äôt leave Russia alone. They have realized that their plan B to supply Ukraine with weapons is also not working. It will not save Ukrainian regime from ultimate defeat and will not even postpone this defeat for noticeably long period of time. 
So we see the phenomenon of ‚ÄúUkraine fatigue‚Äù and more and more voices questioning the feasibility of making Europeans and Americans suffer for Ukraine. The decision makers are still making plans, but it should be obvious for them that those plans will not work. 

üò• Next comes the stage of depression and the collective West is already nearing it. Obvious flaws and plain crimes inevitably get to light, fakes are debunked and everyone except die-hard fanatics are already doubting the narrative showing Ukraine as innocent victim. The stage of depression will come when Western elites will understand that there are no more ways to sustain the Ukrainian war effort and that it‚Äôs time to cut the profit. Their pet media will set the stage and only then the Western society will fully realize whom have they been supporting.

üòëFinal stage is the stage of acceptance. With the West withdrawing its aid Ukraine will not hold even a month. They will capitulate when told to and capitulation of Kiev‚Äôs regime will mean acceptance of new realities by the collective West.

‚ûñThis is a question that worries many people throughout the world watching proxy war between the Russia and the West that currently takes form of Ukrainian conflict. Some of them cheer for Ukraine, some cheer for Russia, most just want to see de-escalation and end of the conflict. 

‚ûñDespite Russian openness to possible diplomatic solution, unrealistic terms of Kiev regime make any form of negotiations impossible. Therefore, the conflict is bound to last until one of the sides surrenders or changes its position. 

‚ûñRussian Federation has obvious advantage in this conflict, while Ukraine would already lose its ability to supply the army if not for military and financial aid from the Western countries. However, even despite this aid, Ukraine is barely holding and as U.S. and European ‚Äúhelpers‚Äù are becoming less and less eager to keep feeding Ukrainian ‚Äúblack hole‚Äù with money and arms, the situation slowly and steadily advances to Russian victory.

‚ûñEconomy of Ukraine is ruined, it lost the ability to service its debt back in August. More than a half of its expenses are currently covered by the West, but this aid does not come for free and when creditors will unfreeze the debts Ukraine will be done no matter what is left of it. 
Energy grid of Ukraine is close to total collapse. Kiev chose military over civilians and cities have electrical power for just a couple hours a day with heating and water supply systems also close to failure in this mode. Food crisis is also looming on the horizon and full-scale humanitarian disaster is a matter of a couple months if not weeks
Supply routes from EU have been seemingly intact for a long time, however there are first signs of their collapse as well ‚Äî this weekend Krivoy Rog railways ceased operation for indefinite period of time. Ukrainian forces use a lot of ammunition and are unlikely to hold for long without steady and continuous supplies.

Predicted shortfalls of U.S. and NATO industry to ramp up production are coming closer and closer and the breakpoint is expected to happen no later than spring. That is, if Ukraine will keep using up ammunition at current rate and if the West will not supply more modern systems. 

‚ûñIt has been stated that the reason for unreadiness of the West is the need to adapt of U.S. and European arms industry for new types of production. Ever since the end of the Cold War NATO has used their military mostly to invade remote countries and therefore arms production was shifted to suit the needs of this kind of warfare.
Most NATO countries have already depleted their stores and are no longer able to help Ukraine with anything, especially with ammunition that is used by Ukraine at the rate unseen since World War 2. Even the U.S., the country with the strongest arms industry in NATO, needs a month to produce the amount of ammunition that Ukraine uses in 2-3 days. 

‚ûñIn face of imminent shortages the U.S.-led NATO is already resorting to alternative options such as supply of older TOW ammunition instead of Javelins, procurement of artillery shells in South Korea and ramping up production of old Soviet-standard weapons at Eastern European plants.
Ukraine‚Äôs own arms industry is close to non-existent and without Western supplies it would simply run out of everything months ago. While alternative options will give Ukraine a chance to last until spring, in some areas its situation is even more dire. 
The most critical of those areas is air defense. Ukraine has about a half of its S-300 batteries left and is already experiencing severe shortage of missiles for those batteries. Neither Ukraine nor any of its partners are able to produce or even maintain missiles for the most famous air defense system of Soviet-era.

‚ûñSupplied small batches of Western air defense systems do not help, Ukraine barely has enough of them to defend one large city and once its S-300 network fails, few NATO-standard batteries won‚Äôt pose serious threat for Russian aviation. Even if NATO countries fulfill all their promises, they are about to supply no more than 20 batteries next year, which is absolutely not enough. The only option is to sacrifice their own systems and go defenseless, but even the most Russophobe countries aren‚Äôt very eager to take this risks.
That said, it is likely that even if Ukraine does not surrender because of blackouts and inability to supply the army, there will be a period when Russian Armed Forces will get the decisive advantage in form of AFU‚Äôs dire deficit of ammunition.

‚ûñSoon after the beginning of the special military operation many eastern European militaries and manufacturers began emptying their warehouses of Soviet-era weapons and ammunition that Ukrainians were familiar with, as Kiev waited for NATO-standard equipment from the West.

‚ûñAs those stocks have dwindled, arms makers have boosted production of both older and modern equipment to keep supplies flowing. The ongoing stream of weapons has helped Ukraine to sustain its army and prevented its early collapse.

‚òùÔ∏èNaturally, this means money. There is a good reason why Russophobe governments of Eastern Europe are so eager in extending this war for as long as possible and keep endorsing Ukrainian regime to continue its hopeless resistance. 

‚ûñTransition to NATO standards of weaponry in Ukraine created a lot of problems and short training does provide necessary skills to operate this weaponry. Therefore, many such systems are operated by foreign mercenaries or under direct control of foreign military advisors. Still, Ukrainians make a lot of blunders with use of Western weapons. Recent report of NASAMS missile hitting a residential building in Kiev is just a tip of an iceberg.

‚ûñCountries like Czechia have long history as arms producers. Back in time of World War II Czech plants were working three shifts to supply the Third Reich with weapons until the very last moment. In times of Warsaw Pact Eastern European arms industry also thrived and produced a lot of military supplies and equipment under Soviet standards. 

‚ûñThey use this experience now to supply Kiev regime with ammunition and weapons that AFU is familiar with and these supplies pose a greater threat for the SMO than all military aid by the West that is not compatible with Ukrainian system and that cannot be effectively used without Western instructors. 

‚ûñSoviet-standard weapons are simple, cheap and reliable and as Ukraine and its backers have depleted most its own Soviet-era arsenals, continued flow of weapons from former communist states of Eastern Europe is becoming more and more critical for survival of Kiev regime.
Therefore, one of the primary short-term objectives of the special military operation should be disruption of this seemingly endless flow of supplies. NATO standard weapons are misused and often end up on black market, but Soviet-standard weapons are the base of continued resistance.

Russian Vice Prime Minister Novak has already declared that Russia is not going to give in and acknowledge any price caps and that Russia will cease supplies to any countries that will implement these restrictions and will either redirect supplies to market-oriented countries or reduce its oil production.

üìû Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday in a phone call with Prime Minister of Iraq that all Western attempts to impose price caps on Russian oil will lead to heavy consequences for the entire world. Kremlin website says:

 ‚ÄúDiscussion also covered situation with attempts of a number of Western countries to impose restrictions on prices of oil materials supplied by Russia. Vladimir Putin stressed that such actions contradict the principles of free market and will highly likely result in heavy consequences for the global energy market.‚Äù

‚ûñThe impact of potential price caps on oil and gas market depends on actual price caps that will be established. While highest proposed range is way above current market prices and is unlikely to impact any supplies, the lowest range that is championed by some of the most Russophobe countries will inevitably result in global shortage of fossil fuels and will push prices up.

‚ùìWhat about the army itself? While it is still being supplied, everything is not so simple. Russian strikes have seriously disrupted Ukrainian supply capabilities and maintaining almost a million-sized army is way above the capacity of Ukraine even with the aid of the collective West because Ukraine has a physical deficit of too many resources to go on.

Zelensky regime keeps pushing the narrative about Russia shelling its own forces defending the power plant and demanding UN to establish a demilitarized zone around the plant. While the reactors are already shut down and the level of risk to them is low, Russia is worried about hazard posed by potential hits to radioactive waste. 

‚ùóÔ∏èRussian nuclear energy experts have proposed evacuation of all hazardous components and materials to Russia. This proposal is indeed feasible as it will reduce the risks of nuclear incidents and will probably stop Ukrainian shelling aimed to cause such incident and put the blame on Russia.

‚ùå EU and G7 are about to implement a new package of sanctions against Russia that will involve oil price cap. It is expected that actual price corridor will be announced this week. Russia has already announced that it is not going to acknowledge any price caps and will sell its oil at its own prices as before. 

‚ùóÔ∏èThe cap seeks to bar shipping companies and insurers from transporting Russian oil unless it is sold below the agreed price cap, and all 27 EU countries need to agree to it for it to enter into force. Diplomats warned they were unsure whether Greece, Cyprus or Malta would have any last-minute concerns as it will obviously hurt their shipping industries. 

‚òùÔ∏èHowever, officials said the EU had already made concessions to the three countries and weakened sanctions on other Russian goods such as fertilizers, cement and other products to soften the blow for their shipping industries. Nonetheless, they are already losing parts of their tanker fleets, which reportedly are already ditching EU flags in favor of those of China, Turkey, India or of various tax havens to avoid the EU and U.S.-imposed price cap.

‚ùìWill it create difficulties for Russia? Maybe there will be some short-term problems, but as a general rule, the longer those US/EU sanctions against Russia will last and the more comprehensive they will be, the more Russia will diversify its economy and trade partners to sustain them until making them irrelevant.

‚ûñAs shown by numerous examples, sanctions never yield the intended results or result in any concessions. In fact, sanctions impose two-way restrictions and cripple all markets they concern, especially in case with such a large exporter as Russia.

‚ûñRussia is not the main victim of Western sanctions against it. The main victims are poor countries of the world that relied on lower prices and are falling deeper into debt unable to sustain their economy in the new reality and unable to challenge the Western World Order. Secondary victims are European countries and their population.

‚ûñEffectively everything will continue as before. Russian partners will keep buying Russian exports and Russia and make a nice profits, Russia will finally sort out its friends and enemies, Europe will continue sacrificing its economic advantages by the order of their U.S. masters and U.S. elites will thrive on suffering of their own populace and populace of their declared friends.

‚ûñEver since the beginning of the Russian SMO in February 2022, Ukraine has been constantly presenting itself as an ‚Äúinnocent victim‚Äù and this narrative has been broadly promoted by American and European media reinforced by numerous fakes prepared by Ukrainian teams. 

‚ûñZelensky can surely be credited for his PR skills, but PR is not everything and has to be continuously reinforced. Every minor victory, every case of regrouping, every tactical retreat are presented as major and decisive victories of Kiev and the narrative of Kiev propagandists is immediately reverberated by the leading media of the collective West. 

‚ûñThis PR machine is absolutely vital for Kiev regime and its sponsors to keep public of Western countries in the dark and convince them that they are suffering to help a noble cause and not wasting money on life support of a doomed regime with strong neo-Nazi ties. 
A country without electricity, fuel and money with unprecedented levels of unemployment and poverty would not last a day without its life support and all media victories of Kiev and its sponsors serve the aim to maintain it and extend the agony of the neo-Nazi regime for ‚Äúas long as it takes‚Äù as head of Pentagon has recently said.

Two Russian nationals, Igor Girkin and Sergey Dubinsky, and Ukrainian citizen Leonid Kharchenko were declared guilty of complicity in the crash of Malaysia Airlines MH17 in eastern Ukraine on July 17, 2014. The defendants were given life sentences. A fourth defendant, Russian citizen Oleg Pulatov, was declared not guilty.

‚ûñAccording to comments of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, both the proceedings and the outcome of the trial prove that the process was based on political agenda with the objective to blame Russia for the tragedy.

‚ûñThroughout the entire proceedings the court had been under unprecedented pressure from politicians and the media. The court ignored the fact that the conclusions of the Dutch prosecutors were based on evidence from anonymous witnesses whose identities had been classified, as well as questionable information and materials provided by an interested party ‚Äì the Security Service of Ukraine, which had been repeatedly caught giving false and contradictory information. 

‚ûñArguments of the defense with regard to lack of any compelling and decisive evidence that MH17 was shot down by a Russian missile was ignored. The court considered only materials that supported the West-promoted version were while declassified documents provided Russian Defense Ministry have been ignored. 

‚ûñThere was an option to receive more clear evidence from US satellite images taken on the day of the crash, but Washington has refused all requests to disclose them fully or partially. 

‚ûñBlindly accepting questionable evidence from an interested party, ignoring evidence provided by defense and issuing the verdict on the basis of assumptions instead of facts violate all common principles of justice including the presumption of innocence. No modern system of law envisages issuing life sentences on the basis of indirect evidence and assumptions.

As it has been predicted, Ukrainian energy grid is slowly going down while Ukrainian leadership is still playing war games ignoring all civilian needs.

‚ùóÔ∏èThe end of the day was marked with a worrisome incident when Polish media announced that territory of the country was hit by two unknown missiles that killed two people and damaged agricultural equipment. Other Western media quickly picked up the story and in less than an hour from the incident one could read that Russia launched a missile strike on Poland. 

‚ûñRussia has immediately refuted the accusations stating that there have been no targets anywhere close to stated strike area. Initially Poland officials were talking about Russian attack but soon after consultation with their NATO colleagues they have changed their rhetoric and asked media to wait until experts inspect the missile.

‚ûñThe following hours were filled with hasty NATO consultations and talks between Washington and Warsaw. We can only guess what they were talking about, but according to initial Polish statements and media message, it was quite likely that some forces were trying to escalate the Ukrainian conflict and openly drag NATO into it.

‚ûñ In the end it was announced that in fact those missiles belonged to Ukraine‚Äôs S-300 defense system and allegedly had defects that resulted in such a gross miss. It is unlikely that NATO countries have believed in intentional or unintentional Russian attack on Poland for even a second. 

‚ûñWe don‚Äôt know if it was indeed an accident, although it will obviously be an official version. However, as Ukrainian situation is absolutely desperate despite their pyrrhic media victories, their only real chance to really overcome Russia is to openly draw NATO into the conflict. 

‚ûñ Poland is known for being one of the most Russophobe countries in Europe and a NATO member, so a missile attack on Poland could yield the desired result for Ukraine. Unfortunately, there will be no real investigation and even if American masters of Ukraine will find out who was responsible, there will be no real punishment. 

‚ûñThings could have went very differently had NATO really wanted to get involved. However, the risks are still present as the Kiev regime can resort to any provocations in its attempts to extend its agony.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2728.0,1.0,2022-11-16T12:04:56+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,32.0,119.0,MessageEntityBold,378.0,86.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,435.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,435.0,,,,,MessageReplies,6.0,25478.0,False,[],,15561.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Message,15248,1639836943,2022-11-16T10:02:43+00:00,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"‚öñÔ∏è The European Union is launching its largest-ever military training mission aimed at preparing an initial 15,000 Ukrainian troops for the battlefield. The main hub for the mission will be in Poland, with a secondary headquarters set up in Germany.
Germany‚Äôs Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht said at a meeting of EU counterparts in Brussels that Berlin was planning to train 5,000 Ukrainians ‚Äúin a wide range of skills‚Äù by next June.

‚ûñ Spanish Defense Minister Margarita Robles said her country would train 400 troops every two months, with a total capacity of 2,400 a year. France last month announced that it would train up to 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers. Britain, Canada, and the United States ‚Äî all fellow NATO countries ‚Äî have already been training Ukrainian military personnel, in Britain and at a US base in Germany.

‚ûñEU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, also attending the defense ministers‚Äô meeting, said that the ‚Äúvery sophisticated‚Äù nature of modern weapons and tactics required that armies employing them ‚Äúbe completely trained.‚Äù ‚ÄúRussia‚Äôs troops are retreating. The war is taking a completely different turn than (Russian President Vladimir) Putin could have imagined when he launched this attack against Ukraine nine months ago,‚Äù he said.

üëÄLet‚Äôs look at the situation from outside. Ukraine is engaged in serious military conflict, Ukraine took huge effort to mobilize hundreds thousands conscripts for this conflict, and then‚Ä¶ it send its troops somewhere to Europe for a few months or a year. Looks like a sound plan? 

‚ûñOf course, we‚Äôll never know it for sure, but there is some probability that all those announcements are just a ruse. We know about Ukrainian practices of covering their losses but it is not a secret that a large part of professional Ukrainian army has already been destroyed and those losses have been covered by mobilized conscripts and foreign mercenaries. 

‚ùóÔ∏èThere is no magic NATO training that will turn a conscript, especially a last wave conscript with no military experience into a professional operator of complex NATO weapons and equipment in just a few months. 

‚òùÔ∏èHowever, there is another version that should be considered. What if those ‚ÄúUkrainian troops‚Äù that are going to be ‚Äútrained‚Äù, are in fact NATO‚Äôs own troops or mercenaries that undergo short drills before being sent to combat in Ukraine. This goes quite in line with overall hypocrisy of NATO and the collective West in this conflict.

‚ûñWhile Biden is trying to figure out what‚Äôs going on at G20, it seems that the U.S. has made the decision and continues pushing Zelensky for further attacks. Euphoria caused by Russian retreat from Kherson is soon to pass, but capture of Kherson does not solve any real problems that Ukraine is facing, and lack of money is the main of those problems.

‚ùóÔ∏èWhile it is likely that the West will use false pretext of recent UN resolution to finally seize frozen Russian funds, those funds will just cover the expenses of the West and won‚Äôt solve system crisis in Ukraine. Ever since August, when Ukraine has de facto defaulted on its debts became bankrupt, it is no longer viable to say that Russia is facing Ukraine at the SMO. A country that is on total life support by another country or group of countries cannot be considered independent. It means that Russian SMO doesn‚Äôt target Ukraine anymore, it targets Ukrainian sponsors from the collective West.

‚ûñTherefore, it doesn‚Äôt matter what Zelensky says. He says what he is told to say because if he says anything that will anger the sponsors, he risks losing all financing and facing rightful trial at Russian court. 
The U.S. fully sees and understands the situation and some forces there understand that it‚Äôs best to negotiate with Russia now, before the situation reverses in Russian favor. Other forces are still cocksure that Russia will lose and are pushing Ukrainian overextended army further and further to its demise. 

‚ûñIt‚Äôs more important that Russia is not ready to enter negotiations with Ukraine or its sponsors on their terms. As Putin said: ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt even started being serious‚Äù.

President Erdogan called it a terrorist attack on the heart of Turkey. The suspect has already been detained and is allegedly a part of Kurdish terrorist group, some of the members of which are attempting to flee to Syria. 

‚ûñThe possible consequences of this act of terror are not clear yet. Looking at this, it is worth noting that Kurds are backed by the U.S. and the European Union and this attack will undoubtedly undermine Turkish relations with them and may even impact Turkish stance on NATO expansion and the Ukrainian conflict. 

‚ûñAs a condition for NATO membership approval, Turkey has demanded Finland and Sweden to extradite several dozens individuals that are, according to Turkey, related to Kurdish terrorist organizations or endorse those organizations. As of beginning of November, Finland and Sweden have not complied with these demands. 

‚ûñSo, if Kurdish involvement in the terrorist attack is confirmed, it is highly unlikely that Turkey will ever back down with this requirement and unless Scandinavian candidates change their position, NATO expansion will be out of question for a long period of time. Turkish society will simply not allow Erdogan any compromises on this matter.

üó£ Russian Duma speaker Volodin stated that 2014 coup d‚Äôetat in Ukraine have resulted in complete loss of sovereignty of the country. Before 2022 its budget deficit was almost 40% covered by foreign loans and credits. Next year deficit will amount 58%

‚ÄúKiev is spending over a half of its income on loan payments and is forced to take new credits. Kiev tries to conceal it, but the problem is obvious. Zelensky has stolen future of Ukrainian people selling the country to debt slavery‚Äù

‚òùÔ∏è In 1990 Ukrainian GDP was $90.3 billion exceeding GDP of countries like Hungary, Poland and Bulgaria. Russia took all USSR‚Äôs debt and Ukraine became an independent state, a country without debts. Ukraine inherited about one third of all Soviet space industry, aviation industry, ship building industry and had really huge industrial capacity at the onset of its existence. 

‚ûñ There was a good reason why Yanukovich‚Äôs government refused to sign the EU association agreement. According to Prime Minister Azarov, Ukraine would need about 160-170 billion euros in ten years only to adapt technical regulations for EU standards as a part of the association agreement. That was about three yearly budgets of Ukraine and almost ten times its national debt by the period. 

‚ùóÔ∏èIn June 2022 Ukraine‚Äôs debt reached historic record of $94 billion.

‚ûñEuropean countries and the U.S. are no longer willing to give ‚Äúfree‚Äù financial and military aid to Ukraine. What does it mean? It means inevitable default and bankruptcy of Ukraine. Nobody will give them anything for free. While Ukraine is already doomed, this does not apply to its regions.

üí°‚ÄúStrana‚Äù has reported about planned preparation of Ukrainian banking system for total blackout lasting from several days to a month referring to a memorandum of the National bank of Ukraine. This memo instructs Ukrainian financial organizations to procure and install backup power sources, including diesel power plants with fuel reserve for at least a week.

üî∑This points that at least Ukrainian financial circles fully understand potential risks that are getting higher with every successful Russian strike on Ukrainian power grid and every decision of the Ukrainian president. Ukrainian authorities acknowledged that if Russian strikes will continue at the same rate, the power grid is bound to collapse before the end of year even if European Union doesn‚Äôt stop supplying power units.
However, failure of the banking system would be the least Ukrainian problem in case of blackout. Especially as this blackout is expected to occur in the middle of winter. Ukraine has not enough autonomous power sources for critical utilities and even if it had them, it does not have enough diesel fuel to run them. 

 üî∑With current level of damage Ukraine can either use the energy grid to maintain normal city life or to power electrical railways and industrial facilities. For now, Kiev government chose a middle way shutting down power for 5-10 hours a day in most Ukrainian cities.   

üî∑Further successful strikes make this choice even harder as longer blackouts in cold time of the year will inevitably cause a humanitarian crisis, a wave of refugees and collapse of Ukrainian ability to supply the front lines and move forces. The government will have to decide what to do with three million people in Kiev that will demand return to normal life.  

 üî∑If this scenario plays out, it will coincide with complete integration of Russian mobilized reservists into combat units in preparation for offensive. Combination of civil disturbance, blackouts and disrupted supplies will wear out the enemy units and may result in collapse of defenses. Despite all cocksure statements of Kiev government, Ukrainians are also tired of the conflict and a lot of them would welcome any compromise that would end their suffering. 

üî∑Naturally, if things go really bad, Ukraine can be connected to Russian energy system. The effect will not be immediate but in case if Ukraine suddenly listens to the voice of reason Russia has the capability to restore power in reasonable time.

üî∑On November 10th the U.S. Department of Commerce announced that it will no longer treat Russia as a market economy. This decision was formally based on such factors as currency convertibility, how wages are determined, the climate for foreign investment, government control of the means of production, government control over firm business decisions and other relevant considerations. 

 üî∑This decision will manifest in extended application of U.S. anti-dumping laws that are now going to restrict Russian exports to prevent competition of Russian companies with American companies. Ideally it would apply only to Russian exports to the U.S., which are negligible. However, the U.S. is well known for extraterritorial application of their laws, so we will probably see them trying to force other countries to impose extra duties on Russian import.

üî∑Whether this decision was justified or not remains a question. Most factors listed by the U.S. have been directly influenced by U.S. own sanctions against Russia that have been mirrored by the European Union and other U.S. satellites. In other words, the U.S. have deliberately forced Russian economy to become ‚Äúnon-market‚Äù.  

 üî∑Convertibility of currency surely became a big problem when leading Russian banks were cut off SWIFT and Russian foreign funds were frozen. Isolation of Russia from the global currency market inadvertently resulted in strengthening of Russian currency that was grossly undervaluated and was influenced by global speculator capital. Government control of means of production and business decisions was a necessity caused by restrictions of import and withdrawal of numerous foreign companies from Russia as the result of economical sanctions. 

‚ùìWhat should Russia do now? Losing this ‚Äústatus‚Äù deprives Russia of the remaining few controversial advantages of WTO membership, so it would be quite reasonable to initiate Russian withdrawal from WTO or at least suspension of Russian membership. For now WTO membership only imposes restrictions on Russia and Russian businesses, giving foreign companies better opportunities.   

üî∑Manual control of trade preferences would be more beneficial both for Russia and its trade partners that remained loyal and did not abandon Russia in hard times. At the same time, it would give a good boost to Russian own import substitution initiatives and can make Russian products more competitive on local and global markets. Russia would be able to impose any desired duties in any sectors of economy without worrying about formal violation of WTO rules. Violations against Russia are ignored but Russian own violations will surely be put to light and disproportionally exaggerated.  

 üî∑Mythical ‚Äúmarket economy‚Äù is not necessarily a good thing. Modern information and communication technologies make the concept of planned economy much more efficient than it was in USSR times and Russia surely could implement a hybrid economical model similar to that used by China, where the state controls strategic sectors of economy and strictly regulates other sectors to ensure continuous improvement of quality of life for all people.

üá∫üá∏November elections in the U.S. are already over and although it seems that Republican did win majority in Congress, it was not an overwhelming victory or expected ‚Äúred wave‚Äù. The Senate breakdown is unclear and it is quite likely that Democratic party will maintain their control. How will these results impact the Ukrainian conflict?

üî∑Despite some Republican slogans about ending U.S. military and financial aid to Ukraine, Russia had no high hopes about the results of the elections. Some signs indicate that Russia did favor the Republicans this time and even withheld announcement of withdrawal from Kherson city in Ukraine until the voting ended.

üî∑Nonetheless, Russia knows that the majority of U.S. Republicans just as the majority of U.S. Democrats are not Russian friends and will not do anything that will look as a favor to Russia. U.S. support to Ukraine depends more on physical constraints and situation in U.S. economy than on the party controlling the House. 

üî∑If any changes are expected about U.S. aid to Ukraine, those are changes about accountability. Both Republicans and Democrats are concerned about rumors of U.S.-supplied weapons ending on black market and on very high level of corruption in the AFU. 

üî∑According to recent reports, the U.S. are now planning to supply Ukraine with some older stocked weaponry because they are out of reserve stock for newer models and are not able to replenish this stock quickly and provide the necessary ammunition, production ramp will take from 1 to 3 years. 

üî∑That said, with Ukrainian counter-offensive soon to be stalled on the Dnieper and stabilization of the front line, further development of the situation will depend on Russian ability to disable enemy equipment. Neither Europe, nor the U.S. are willing to make their industry work solely to supply Ukraine and Ukrainian army. Ukraine‚Äôs own arms industry has very limited capacity and is mostly used to repair damaged tanks and vehicles. 

üî∑This means that at some point of time foreign sponsors will no longer be able to replenish Ukraine‚Äôs losses, be it U.S. Republicans, U.S. Democrats or whoever else. The only thing Russia has to do is to outlast Ukraine and win the war of attrition and it looks like this is the tactics chosen by the Russian Ministry of Defense for this very reason.

‚òùÔ∏èAmidst numerous events of the past days and weeks and global focus on Ukrainian conflict the Western world seems to ignore things happening in other regions and Russian news seem to be forgetting about that as well.  

üëäMeanwhile, according to Arab News, on November 9th ‚Äúunknown force‚Äù has launched an air-strike on a truck convoy in eastern Syria killing a number of Iranian nationals protecting it. It was a transit convoy carrying Iranian oil to Lebanon through Syria. While US hasn‚Äôt confirmed its responsibility for this strike, it should be noted that in August the US military carried out airstrikes in Deir ez-Zor targeting Iran-backed militiamen. The Pentagon said the strikes were a message to Iran and Tehran-backed militias that targeted American troops earlier that month and several other times over the past year. 

 üî∑Right at the moment over two thousands of Syrian refugees are held in al-Rukban camp by US-controlled paramilitary forces. Americans have not allowed Russian experts to enter the camp to evaluate humanitarian situation.  

üî∑Back in September the US announced construction of another military base in oil-rich Syrian province of Deir ez-Zor. While the public of the Western world and virtually all Western media are focused on Ukrainian conflict, the United States keep illegally occupying North-Eastern Syria, they keep extracting Syrian oil and transporting it to Iraq, they keep attacking forces aligned with the government of Syria and show no signs of remorse or any desire to retreat.   

‚ùìWhere is the reaction of the global community to U.S. illegal occupation of Syria that continues for seven years? Where are sanctions against U.S., where are demands for US to compensate all Syrian oil that has been stolen and hauled to Iraq on road tankers? Where is the righteous rage of global community, where is European coalition urging for global peace? 

 üî∑Moreover, U.S. involvement in Syria can in no way be compared to Russian special operation in Ukraine. U.S. presence there is totally illegitimate and not justified by any international laws or any international bodies. There are no American people in Syria, Syrian government does not discriminate any ethnicities and endorses moderate secular branch of Islam unlike Jihadists supported by US weapons. The U.S. occupies a territory of an independent state and keeps bringing more and more troops and weapons to the occupied area, which also happens to be the most resource-rich area of the country.  

 üî∑In fact, U.S. involvement in Syria can be compared to U.S. involvement in Ukraine eight years ago ‚Äîarming anti-government insurgents, launching global media campaign against the government, promising all support to the opposition. They won in Ukraine but they didn‚Äôt yet win in Syria and decided to keep the sweet part of the country for themselves.  

üî∑Another parallel, U.S. intervention in Syria gave rise to ISIS and U.S. intervention in Ukraine gave rise to neo-Nazis. Maybe there is something wrong with U.S. interventions as they result in rise of the most notorious forces?  

üî∑As for Syria, there are little chances that U.S. forces will leave the country voluntarily.

Those thousands of Germans don‚Äôt want to starve or freeze for Ukrainian President Zelensky‚Äôs war that was provoked and engaged in by the U.S.A., E.U. and NATO. As Germany and Europe feel the pain of increasingly economic hardship, German and other European governments may finally start listening to public opinion and succumb to the pressure of their people.

‚ñ´Ô∏èFollowing Nord Stream attack staged by the U.K. and the U.S. German leader has already showed some spine against Joe Biden. While he is still too scared of making peace with Russia, he went openly defying Biden as far as China is concerned. 

‚ñ´Ô∏èNord Stream was damaged but when the truth was uncovered the outcome turned favorable for Russia and China. France‚Äôs Macron is openly speaking against US charging $1320 for the same gas that was charged $300 by Russia and Scholz sold a 25% stake of Hamburg Port to a Chinese company.

‚ñ´Ô∏èScholz literally braved all opposition by Blinken and his own minister Habeck and went to China against all odds. He went with many companies for a lot of business discussions. Scholz had refused the offer of President Macron to join him and present a common European approach in his recent visit to Beijing.

‚ñ´Ô∏èAlthough Scholz was not very well received in China, it‚Äôs worth noting that he told Xi Jingping to call on Putin to have a ceasefire on Ukraine. While it looks routine, in fact it means that a European leader asks Chinese leader to help establish peace ignoring the U.S. role completely. That‚Äôs an unimaginable loss of face for the U.S. from Chinese point of view.

‚ñ´Ô∏èSo, while Europe is not turning to Russia, there is some chance that Europe will turn away from U.S. and to the Eurasian initiatives. The other alternative is becoming economic slaves to U.S. oil companies as per our previous material.

‚ûñTypical Western propaganda keeps talking about NATO posing no threat to Russia and membership in NATO being a free choice of members and saying that Russia should have been forging better relations with its neighbors to prevent them from joining NATO. Many Americans and Europeans sincerely believe this. 

‚ûñThis is a problem of key difference in perception between the West and Russia. How could Russia know that NATO posed no threat? Because NATO said so? Russians saw more and more countries joining the alliance, Russians saw NATO military bases moving closer and closer to Russian borders. What should they think? That NATO are fluffy bunnies and don‚Äôt want to hurt anybody? 

‚ûñMaybe it was pure coincidence that leading NATO countries criticized Russian way of life, called Russia an authoritarian tyranny, accused Russia of imperialistic ambitions. They were constantly stating that Russia needs ‚Äúmore democracy‚Äù and used Russian relaxed laws to overwhelm the country with their NGOs, which supported street populists and most anti-government and anti-patriotic forces, including most notorious. 

‚ûñNATO actions very closely resembled scenarios of color revolutions that destroyed many countries and have not brought any good results in any single case. Maybe Russians should have believed that the West knows better how they should live, what should be their values and how should their country behave globally? 
Forging better relations is a great idea but nobody can say that Russia did not try it. However, these attempts were always met with strong opposition of NATO leaders. So how could Russia do it? With money? Money does not buy everything and Russia did not resort to cheap and empty promises, although that is what people really see. 

‚ûñLet‚Äôs take Ukraine. Russia subsidized Ukraine for decades ever since USSR collapse. Russia sometimes sold gas to Ukraine cheaper than to its local consumers, Russia provided Ukraine with cheap loans, Russia gave Ukraine trade preferences. Did it help? No. Why? Because the collective West uses its money not to help countries but to get control of mass media in those countries. 

‚ûñNATO leaders have decades of experience in PR technologies and promoting their agenda. They control English-language mainstream media that cover more than half of the world. They are not charities, they don‚Äôt help countries, but promote bright pictures of their own prosperity and imply that it‚Äôs easy to get that. They are not saying anything about the real costs.

‚ûñFor example, Russia offered multi-billion orders to Ukrainian industry. The West offered nice European picture. Just join the West, join EU, join NATO and you‚Äôll be safe and prosperous. Sign this association agreement and you‚Äôll get rich next day. No need to look at real conditions. 

‚ûñWhat did Ukraine choose? And it‚Äôs not just Ukraine. Georgia and Moldova also took this road, Armenia changed its mind when it was already too late and Belarus avoided serious turmoil only because of its close integration with Russia.

‚ûñSo, did NATO pose a threat to Russia? Yes. NATO bases and arms in Europe presented military threat to Russia, while NATO countries attempted to interfere in Russian internal politics and actively worked to undermine Russian relations with neighboring countries.

‚ûñAs Ukrainian conflict rages on, Russian missile strikes continue to disrupt operation of Ukrainian energy grid. Every day there is air alert in at least several large cities if not all. Blackouts are becoming a common thing, people in Kiev has to spend from 5 to 10 hours without electricity. 

‚ûñUkraine‚Äôs president Zelensky ignores all Russian offers to return to negotiations and this means that these strikes will continue. European countries are helping Ukraine overcome the energy shortage, but it doesn‚Äôt really work. Total blackout is looming on the horizon and it is about to create one of the largest migration crisis in history.

‚ûñEven Ukrainian government urges Ukrainians to leave the country. That‚Äôs yet another sign of failed state, but that‚Äôs another topic. Anyway, there are not many places where Ukrainians can go ‚Äì it‚Äôs either Russia or the West. Despite all Western propaganda, millions of Ukrainians would still prefer Russia as they have friends and family ties there. However, it is unlikely that Ukrainian government will let them pass through the front lines unharmed or will let them ever come back. 
Therefore, all those millions of refugees are going West. Europe is already overwhelmed by Ukrainian refugees. Initially they were welcomed everywhere but as time passed, things started to change. In light of energy crisis European governments are encouraging all possible saving measures and subsidies to people hosting refugees are among those costs that can be cut down. 

‚ûñThe influx of Ukrainian migrants has already caused numerous problems. Ukrainians usually don‚Äôt speak languages of countries where they stay, they create extra burden on social security system of the host countries, they are trying to find jobs and work hard, but that is also not viewed very well. Energy crisis will inevitably increase the level of unemployment in Europe and locals won‚Äôt be happy about competition and dumping pressure from Ukrainians or anyone else.

‚ûñThe issue of housing is also pending. Very few Ukrainians managed to find any permanent place to live on their own, most are still using refugee camps or are hosted by hospitable Europeans. However, despite all this hospitability, this is not a permanent solution.

‚ûñThere will be problems even with the existing number of migrants, but if their number increases, the outcome will be catastrophic. Europe won‚Äôt be able to provide them normal living conditions, healthcare, schools, pensions, jobs. Even the richest countries such as UK, Germany and France are already facing budget problems because of energy crisis, inflation and numerous other issues. They are spending billions every month to subsidize housing, food, healthcare and schools for Ukrainian migrants, but those billions are needed elsewhere and, moreover, available resources are limited.

‚ûñZelensky is using the situation to blackmail Europeans demanding multi-billion subsidies and supply of energy and power grid equipment threatening to send more migrants across the border.

There is 2 notions we need to know; De juro and De Facto
De Juro means LEGAL, or according to the law. 
De Facto means , what is actually going on. ( not based on the law) 
Russia is accused to violate international law. Law that is stipulated in UN charter. 
Accusations  that have been made by  the presidents and high-ranking politicians in US and  European countries. 
It is a bit complicated to explain the full scope of legality in the matter so let me present a light version. 

The USSR is still exiting De Juro. 
But De Facto it is gone and we have 15 sovereign republics in the post Soviet space. 

The fall of the USSR is the result of illegal actions of Gorbatjov. 
There is a lawsuit pending against him. A grassroots organization is gathering 1 million signatures to follow with the lawsuit. 
People are asking the Supreme Court of Russian Federation to give a legal assessment to Gorbatjov actions. 
When the ruling comes, Russia will withdraw the recognition of Ukrainian sovereignty and the matter will become an internal affair of RF. 
All according to the international law. 
This is a lawful and peaceful solution to the conflict. 

After that, all party‚Äôs involved in military conflict will have to stop weapons delivery and leave Ukraine. 
Because if they don‚Äôt , Russia will have the right to defend herself.

‚ùóÔ∏èThe notion for inviolability of borders in Europe has been established by the Helsinki Act of 1975, which also rejected any use of force or intervention in internal affairs and urged the signatories to respect human rights.

‚òùÔ∏èThis Act lasted until 1990 when West Germany (FRG) annexed East Germany (GDR). This was followed by collapse of USSR, collapse of Yugoslavia, split of Czechoslovakia, Balkan wars, civil conflicts in ex-USSR, Kosovo and Russian reunion with Crimea.

‚ûñIt looks like inviolability of borders is in fact a myth that has never been true. Nations evolve, countries evolve, people change. Especially if we stop considering Europe to be something special. Post-WW2 world order stayed for almost 40 years, yet many borders were revamped and changed during and after that. 

‚ûñHistory knows many examples of Empire dismantling and when it happens quickly (like dissolution of Austro-Hungary) , this resulted in more conflicts in future (pre-WW2 and WW2 changes of borders in Southern Europe). Same about collapse of the Ottoman Empire that caused chaos in the Middle East and issues that are still existing (Armenians expelled from core Armenia, no state for Kurds). British Empire was dismantled in a more orderly way, but there still were conflicts.

‚ûñSo there is no wonder that not everyone on post-USSR space is happy with administrative and territorial division of the USSR. Especially since this division was arbitrary changed many times during communist rule. It happened so that Ukrainian SSR got a number of core Russian regions from USSR.

‚ûñYes, USSR‚Äôs administrative borders were recognized and everything was fine as long as we were parts of the same Soviet Union and the same nation of Soviet people. It really mattered only for administrative purposes and no conflicts were really serious. By the way, even Karabakh conflict wasn‚Äôt a thing in USSR times, and Armenians and Azerbaijani were not THAT hostile to each other because they both were a part of something greater. 

‚ûñSo, USSR gave Ukraine Russian lands and post-Soviet Russia acknowledged it. However, this acknowledgment lasted only while Ukraine remained a friendly or neutral state and was a part of post-Soviet integration projects, such as the mostly impotent CIS. 

‚ûñIn 2022 Russia got out of patience with Ukrainian hostility and now Russians are back for their lands.

ü§îRussia probably didn‚Äôt do things the right way in some sense. It could have prepared formal territorial claims, withdrawn recognition of Ukraine and done other things to really legitimize its actions and formalize its demands. Russian public would probably see it as pointless waste of time, but that would be as important as running referendums on new territories.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1981.0,7.0,2022-11-08T10:05:21+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,5.0,89.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,414.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,414.0,,,,,MessageReplies,5.0,25478.0,False,[],,15577.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

‚ûñ First week of November was marked with official confirmation of US military presence in Ukraine. High-ranked Pentagon official, Air Force Brigadier General Pat Ryder, has confirmed that active-duty U.S. military are deployed inside Ukraine and have ‚Äúresumed on-site inspections to assess weapon stocks‚Äù. 

‚ûñ General said that these U.S. military are far away from any type of front line actions and are relying on Ukrainians to do the fighting. He did not directly respond to the question about what would these U.S. military do if deliberately or inadvertently targeted by Russian attack. 
This statement followed a release of State Department report on its plans to Counter Illicit Diversion of Certain Advanced Conventional Weapons in Eastern Europe. The report referred to ‚Äúa variety of criminal and non-state actors [who] may attempt to acquire weapons from sources in Ukraine during or following the conflict, as occurred after the Balkan Wars in the 1990s.

‚ûñ However, those criminal actors are embedded in the Ukrainian military, particularly in the form of the fascistic Azov Batallion, which is playing a frontline role in the war against Russia and whose leaders have been brought to Washington and feted by Congressmen, Democrat and Republican alike.

‚ûñ The open secret is that the actual US force presence in Ukraine is far greater even than that admitted by the Pentagon. It has been acknowledged that U.S. provides intelligence data to Ukraine, helps them choose targets and gives approval for use of certain weapons such as HIMARS. 

‚ûñ Those alleged inspectors will not really be able to find anything wrong without going directly to the front lines, as most weapon losses are registered in combat zone and the only way to verify the reports is to be actually present in the area. 

‚ûñ It is more likely that this announcement marks the increase in numbers of U.S. military advisors (now called ‚Äúinspectors‚Äù) to the level when it becomes hard for Pentagon to deny their presence.

‚ûñ The longest period of peace in Europe lasted from 1945 to 1991 and was the accomplishment of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics that defeated Nazi Germany and established balance of power inside Europe. 

‚ûñThis power balance of bipolar world was the only thing that prevented open wars between countries ‚Äì countries within one block wouldn‚Äôt fight each other and would avoid local violence because it could trigger interference of the other block. There were few really neutral states but as the blocks were constantly ready for war with each other, there was no war. 

‚ûñThe balance of power in Europe was destroyed in 1989-1991 with dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union. The Soviet side has voluntarily decided to stop confrontation and made a giant step to stable peace based not on mutual assured destruction but on trust and cooperation. However, the other side was not so noble and simply declared itself a winner and started enjoying the spoils. The balance of power shifted and the strongest side thought that it has a right to decide the issues of war, peace and the way that other countries should follow.

‚ûñNow, which ‚Äúevery‚Äù nations have exactly signed for peace in Europe? NATO countries? The ones that bombed Yugoslavia, which is a European country just a bit over 20 years ago? It‚Äôs not that much. 20 years is not ‚Äúlasting peace‚Äù. 

‚ûñAnd Europe is more than just that. Is Artsakh not Europe? Is Armenia not Europe? What about Georgia? Some other continent? There have been no ‚Äúpeace in Europe‚Äù ever since the fall of the Warsaw pact. 

‚ûñOne more thing ‚Äì why is Europe so special? Why should it be safe from conflicts? How is it better than the Middle East or Africa or Asia? Conflicts don‚Äôt come out of nowhere. They come when nations see no other options. Russians are doing what they have to do. They weren‚Äôt the one who started violence. Violence was started by Russian enemies and Russia is ending it.

‚ûñEuropean proposal was less specific and more vague. Europe did propose an association agreement, however this agreement did not contain any specific bonuses for Ukraine, in fact it was a list of demands that Ukraine had to meet to be considered for EU candidate status.

‚ûñ Yes, Russian state media have been blocked on virtually all platforms in the West. English-language TV channels from Russia lost their licenses, most official Russian channels on YouTube*, Facebook* and other social media have been blocked and websites of Russian media have been blocked in the West. 
First of all, it‚Äôs important to ask a question why they were blocked? The West claimed that they are spreading ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù but it hasn‚Äôt provided any proof of that except ‚Äúwe think so‚Äù. It‚Äôs worth noting that measures against Russian channels have been taken immediately after the start of Russian special operation in Ukraine. It looks like that Western governments didn‚Äôt really want their people to learn anything about Russian side of the story. 

‚ùìWhy would they block Russian sources? Even if they think that Russians are distorting information, why don‚Äôt they let their own people decide whether Russian facts are true or not. Maybe they consider their people too easy to manipulate, and maybe they have a good reason to think so because they are successfully doing it themselves? Or maybe they consider their people too smart and are afraid that they will see a point of reason in Russian media?

‚ûñUkrainian media enjoys full preferences in the West. Their stories get to headlines, their statements are rarely verified and even when their ‚Äúfacts‚Äù are proven to be fake, they are not debunked on first pages. Europe is supposedly having some concerns about freedom of speech in Russia yet they have implemented media control on the level that would make envious even the most totalitarian countries. 
The damage is already done. Swift decisions of European authorities convinced the mainstream European audience that Ukrainian cause is right and that Russians are some monstrous orcs that have launched a Waaagh campaign against Europe. Even thinking and intelligent Europeans have been exposed to one and only side of the story that was reinforced through most mainstream channels. 

‚ùìSo, what about Russian side of the story? The higher are the costs that Europe has to pay for its involvement in Ukrainian conflict, the more Europeans are starting to question the official narrative, which often contradicts itself or quite obvious facts. 

‚ûñUnfortunately, Russian official channels are still blocked from the mainstream audience in the West. There are independent journalists, bloggers and channels covering the Ukrainian conflict and global geopolitical conflict of Russia with the West on various lesser social media such as Rumble, Odysee, Telegram and others. 

‚ûñRumble video platform is especially worth noting as it has explicitly rejected the demand of French government to block Russian news sources, such as RT France and Sputnik. Rumble has instead chosen to pull its services from France rather than comply with the order. ‚ÄúThe French Government has demanded that Rumble rumblevideo block Russian news sources. Like elonmusk, I won‚Äôt move our goal posts for any foreign government,‚Äù Rumble CEO Chris Pavlovski tweeted.

Hopefully, after this decision Russian presence on alternative media platforms will expand. So while mainstream platforms are applying censorship and promoting what they are told to promote, there still are some other channels where Europeans can looked for Russian side of the story or balanced information. It‚Äôs good to know that at least some platforms really embrace the principle of freedom of speech.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2183.0,21.0,2022-11-07T08:46:43+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,121.0,MessageEntityItalic,2975.0,160.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,407.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,407.0,,,,,MessageReplies,18.0,25478.0,False,[],,14535.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

‚ûñThis economic war was not declared by Russia, so Russia has not set any objectives for it. Europe did declare economic war on Russia that took the form of massive anti-Russian sanctions. When these sanctions were initially announced, their declared objectives were ‚Äúto cripple Russian war machine and Russian economy making it impossible for Russia to continue military activities in Ukraine‚Äù and to ‚Äústimulate regime change in Russia‚Äù. 

‚ûñSo, since Russian economy is getting better every month and Russian defense industry is working three shifts with noticeably increased production volumes as compared to previous year, it does not look like this crippling objective has worked to any noticeable extent. Russian military is fully supplied and stocked with all necessary equipment and ammunitions, there have been no reports of any shortages. 

‚ûñWhile the government appreciates support of volunteers and army support funds, it has several times announced that there is no need for any extra financial commitments by citizens or organizations. When several regions have proposed to cancel New Year celebrations and send saved money to the army, the Kremlin has officially stated that this should not be even considered. 

‚ûñAs time went by, Europeans have invented another objective ‚Äî to get fully independent on Russian energy resources and substitute Russia with other suppliers. Despite the fact that Russia has been a stable and reliable supplier for many decades, Europeans decided to break those ties all at once. Even then, Russia did not terminate supplies immediately and is in fact supplying energy to Europe even now with some routes running through Ukraine.

‚ûñAnyway, this objective has been virtually achieved. Europe is getting independent of Russian energy, Russian food and Russian everything. As for the costs and consequences‚Ä¶ it doesn‚Äôt look like Europe ever thought about it. European governments are surely not going hungry, unlike their people.
Let‚Äôs take an example of the United Kingdom, which is one of the most active proponents of anti-Russian sentiments in Europe and is suspected of direct acts of sabotage against Russian and German infrastructure. 

‚ûñAccording to latest data, 9.7 million adults and over 4 million children in the United Kingdom have experienced food poverty last month, which means they could not afford three meals a day.

‚ûñToday Russian ministry of defense has announced that Russia resumes it participation in ‚Äúthe grain deal‚Äù upon receiving sufficient guarantees of safety. It‚Äôs worth noting that withdrawal from the grain deal was the result of outrageous terrorist attack on Russian Black Sea fleet at the port of Sevastopol that was staged under cover of the ‚Äúgrain corridor‚Äù.

‚ûñSince it doesn‚Äôt look like Russia was pressured, this probably means that proposed guarantees and benefits were indeed serious. It‚Äôs worth noting that Turkey was very active in its attempts to revive the grain deal as one of its beneficiaries. Since Russian-Turkish relations are very important in light of Russian conflict with the West, it seems that President Erdogan managed to convince the Russian side to give the deal another chance.

What are the pros and cons of Russian return to the grain deal? 

‚ûñThere are several possible benefits. First of all, there must be some guarantees and benefits that aren‚Äôt yet publicized. Second, this gives a great boost to Erdogan and potentially a great profit to Turkey, which is now set to become both gas hub and grain hub for the Europe getting a serious leverage over it. While strengthening of Turkey is not directly beneficial to Russia, this makes it much likelier that Turkey will remain neutral and will keep blocking certain NATO initiatives such as adding Finland and Sweden to the alliance. 

‚ûñThere is also a humanitarian aspect of the deal. While Russia could supply some of its grain to the poorest countries and did commit to do it, the whole existence of the grain corridor did positively impact global prices on grain and reduced the risks of hunger in regions susceptible to those risks.

‚ûñAnother benefit is about guarantees given by Ukraine. To resume the deal, Ukraine provided written guarantees that it will not use the grain corridor for further terrorist attacks. Firstly, it looks like these guarantees were given not only to Russia but also to Turkey and the UN. It is quite likely that Ukraine will once again attempt terrorist attack on Russian Black Sea fleet or Crimea or that its Anglo-Saxon backers will push it to such an attack. If such thing happens, it will deal a huge blow to Ukrainian image and all Ukrainian guarantees and statements thus strengthening Russian positions. 

‚ûñSecond, the very fact of these guarantees means that Ukraine has implicitly acknowledged its responsibility for the previous attack. This guarantee is indirect proof of that, so Ukrainian image of being all nice has already suffered. Even if Ukraine tries again, Russian forces will still stay on alert so it is unlikely that Russia will suffer any serious damage because of this decision. 

‚ûñThird, return to the grain deal nullifies the European initiative to arrange grain transportation over land routes through Moldova. Black Sea route is much less complicated, much simpler and makes sure that at least some grain gets to those who really need it and doesn‚Äôt end in Europe in its entirety. 

‚ûñThe fourth aspect is more about military situation in the Black Sea. Without grain corridor Ukraine could return to the practice of laying mines around its coast in Odessa area, which would create obstacles not only for sea transports but also for possible Russian naval operations in that area.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,1782.0,3.0,2022-11-03T16:08:36+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,27.0,MessageEntityBold,834.0,66.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,402.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,402.0,,,,,MessageReplies,0.0,25478.0,False,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Die Regierungen versuchen sich mit dem Krieg in der Ukraine herauszureden, allerdings ist dieser nur ein Katalysator. Er hilft mit, ist aber nicht die eigentiche Ursache, und auch da ist nicht der Krieg selbst, sondern die Finanzierung des Krieges und die Sannktionen gegen Russland die Ursache der Probleme. 

Die EU treibt sich in eine beispiellose Verschuldung, schafft aber keinen einzigen Wert damit, nimmt sich aber den Spielraum, den es braucht, wenn man irgendeine Entwicklung wieder ansto√üen m√∂chte.

‚ùóDass das Board mit seiner Einsch√§tzung ablosut richtig liegt kann man unteranderem an der sehr kurzen Amtszeit von Liz Truss sehen. 

Sie hatte versucht, eine auf der Modern Money Theory basierende Wirtschaftspolitik die Krise im UK in den Griff zu bekommen, konnte diese sog. Wirtschaftshilfen aber nicht finanzieren.

üëå To some extent. It is quite possible that Western leaders think this way. They view this trade as a benefit. Maybe they could use this option as leverage in negotiations with Russia, but they can‚Äôt use this carrot to make Russia accept an ultimatum. 

‚ûñRussian concerns still have to be addressed and a solution has to be developed for each of the four objectives that Russia has established for the special operation in Ukraine. 
Now, when dust has settled, Russians no longer think that trade with the West is a ‚Äúcarrot‚Äù, many view it as a ‚Äúpoison apple‚Äù that resulted in destruction of Russian industry. Resuming trade with the West looks an easy way to improve and grow Russian economy, but the easy way isn‚Äôt always the right way.

‚ûñLooking at consequences of disruption of trade with Russia for the collective West, we could in fact say that it is Russia that could use ‚Äúresuming trade‚Äù as a carrot to bring the West to negotiation table if Russians want it. 

‚ûñWhile Russia sure had to deal with some problems as the result of sanctions and disruption of supply chains, it does not look like Russia is having any serious problems with its internal economy. Inflation has stabilized after a spike in the beginning of year and there are no shortages of any vital consumer goods. 
Russia has survived the most dangerous period of crisis and severance of economic ties with the West without noticeable losses. The bottom point is already behind us and things are getting better and better with every month. 

‚ûñAs for the West, it is not monolithic with this regard. While the United States did not have any serious problems because of breaking ties with Russia and even managed to capitalize on it, for Europe the situation is different. 

‚ûñThe United States are still facing an economy crisis and potential recession, but it has more to do with economic policies of the incumbent President than with anything that is going on in the Eastern hemisphere. The longer this situation lasts, the more American people want to see the government focus on internal problems instead of spending money somewhere on another side of the world. 

‚ûñAs for Europe, its economy was much more intertwined with Russian and severance of ties did create serious problems, which have not fully manifested yet. It turned out that while sheer volume of trade with Russia was not so high, it was import of Russian energy that made the wheels of European economy running. Without Russian supplies European industrial machine faced problems and those are not short-term problems that can be fixed with emergency measures but a critical issue that could result in total collapse of European industry. 

‚ûñFor now, Europe is just paying whatever it takes to keep things running. This is an emergency approach and it works to an extent unless another emergency happens. However, this is not a viable long-term solution because it undermines competitiveness of European industry and economy. Unlike Russia, Europe is not self-sufficient in terms on energy. 

ü§îSo, the West can offer Russia fancy brands and shiny stuff and Russia can offer the West much needed energy that is vital to make those shiny things.

Shortly followed by news that troops were moved into Kherson. If both are true, is Russia swapping out it's quality troops for the newly mobilized and more disposable units?

‚ûñThose reports misinterpreted facts or were just false.
Russia did evacuate civilian population from the Western bank of Dnieper claiming that the purpose of evacuation if to protect civilians in case of possible Ukrainian assault on the city and sabotage of Kakhovskaya hydropower plant that could flood the area.

‚ûñThis evacuation is going on even now because Ukraine is indeed shelling the dam for a month already and seems that Russian military intelligence is expecting a massive strike. 

‚ûñAt the same time Russia is slowly and gradually reinforcing its defenses on Kherson front and turning Kherson city into a fortress. In fact it is doing a similar thing to what Ukraine was doing in Mariupol or Zaporozhye with an important difference that Russia does not make civilians stay there as human shields. 
However, it looks like evacuation was also a clever military trick. Ever since it was announced, Ukrainian (and Western) media started shouting about imminent recapture of Kherson by Ukrainians. They thought that Russians are planning to withdraw and abandon Kherson without a fight and probably decided that it would be an easy game to capture it. 

‚ûñ This impacted not only media dimension - Ukraine has really brought a lot of reserves to Kherson region and made over 20 attempts to start an offensive in the last month. However, all such attempts were repealed with heavy losses for Ukraine and it looks like Russia is ready to continue defending this front for as long as it may be needed.

‚ûñAnother possible reasons for Ukrainian failure to start an offensive in Kherson include reluctance of foreign mercenary forces to go into the breach. There have been rumors that they refused to go to die and so Ukraine has to bring more and more forces from other areas. 

‚ûñNow, if this was a trick, it was indeed a clever one because it used dominance of Ukrainian side in Western media and resulted in Western sponsors of Ukraine believing that Russians are really weak in Kherson. The sponsors kept pushing Ukraine for attack and really expected it, which is obvious from English-language media headlines from the last month that were all shouting about Russian weaknesses and imminent Ukrainian victory.

‚ûñSince Kherson is an important position and Ukraine still has a large concentration of forces on that front, Russia is not yet rotating regular army units that are defending it. Instead, Russia is reinforcing them with newly mobilised reservists and more equipment. 
Naturally, as soon as the risk of Ukrainian assault on Kherson front gets lower, regular army units and best reservists will first get some rest and then it will be possible to use them for offensive purposes leaving the Kherson front line defended with less experienced but no less formidable forces.

‚ûñThis is not happening yet. It will most likely happen either when Ukrainians start concentrating their forces on another part of the front (and there were news that they are indeed moving reserves to a different area) or when Russia will be ready to resume offensive operations without worrying about Ukrainian army. This will most likely happen once the remaining Ukrainian fortification lines in Donbass fall. For several weeks Ukraine has been suffering daily heavy losses in desperate attempts to hold Artemovsk but this week Russia also started advancing in Ugledar area, which may mean that the stalemate period is about to end pretty soon. 

‚ûñUkraine is already out of reserves in Donbass, Russian missile strikes reduced its capability to quickly move troops around by electrified railways and withdrawal of forces from another area will bury the idea of counter-offensive and will probably be viewed as big loss by Western sponsors of Ukraine and without their aid Ukraine can‚Äôt last more than a couple months both in military and economical aspect.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2110.0,4.0,2022-11-01T12:43:06+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,154.0,97.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,394.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,394.0,,,,,MessageReplies,2.0,25478.0,False,[],,13899.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They started when president Yanukovich rejected a deal about closer association with the European Union. Even Western polls show that back at the time only 45 percent of Ukrainians supported association with EU, while 15 percent of Ukrainians supported integration with Russia and the rest just wanted to leave things as they are. 

‚ûñYanukovich didn‚Äôt dump the idea of EU association but rejected the proposed deal because its terms were not favorable for Ukraine and would result in Ukrainian industry getting totally uncompetitive and its gradual takeover by foreign businesses. 

‚ûñIn either case, it was a legitimate right of a legitimate President to make a decision about certain treaties. However, regions opposing the President had a different opinion and started mass protests that have been officially and openly support by foreign countries and were most noticeable in Kiev, the capital of Ukraine that had pro-Western moods and didn‚Äôt vote for Yanukovich. Essentially, sympathies of Kiev populace have decided the fate of Yanukovich‚Äôs government ‚Äì he was overthrown and fled the country fearing for his life. 

‚ûñWhy did it happen? Because people want prosperity and good life. Promise them more of that, convince them that the government is bad and new government will change things to better and you can create a rebellion. Especially if things are not that bad but could be better. 


‚ûñThe Party of Regions and the Communist Party of Ukraine, two prominent opposition forces that collectively got about 60 percent votes on previous elections, were disbanded and prohibited by decision of the new powers.

‚ûñSince these parties lost their representation, any further elections cannot be considered legitimate. Some say that this applies only to Poroshenko‚Äôs government and that Zelensky was elected legitimately.

üëÜIn previous piece we have talked about Ukrainian ‚Äúfreedoms‚Äù that Russia is fighting against. Now let‚Äôs talk a little bit about Ukrainian democracy.

‚ûñBasic meaning of democracy means the rule of people. Since all people are different and may have different opinions on different matters, the concept of democracy effectively means the rule of majority and the will of majority is manifested in form of democratic elections with equal rights of vote and equal opportunities to be voted for. 

‚ûñDoes Ukrainian government reflect the will of majority? Could be, but there is no real way to verify it because Ukrainian process of elections was not democratic by the very definition of it. 

‚ûñAlthough the West praises 2014 coup and fully acknowledges its results, from legal point of view it was just the act of overthrowing legitimate government through the means of street protests in the capital. It mirrors the events of ‚ÄúOrange Revolution‚Äù that happened in 2004 and also ended with victory of rebels. 

‚ûñIn 2004 Victor Yanukovich, candidate from the powerful Party of Regions, has won presidential elections by a small margin winning overwhelming majority of votes in a number of Ukraine regions. However, his political opponent did not acknowledge defeat and incited his followers to go out on the streets and demanded to repeat the election process once again. We won‚Äôt get deep into the reasons for why the results of revoting were different from the original results, but maybe, just maybe broad public campaign, global media support and aggressiveness of protesters could have something to do with it. 

‚ûñPresident Yutschenko that embodied ‚ÄúWestern values‚Äù did get his term and this term was not famous for any remarkable achievements except for increased tensions with Russia, continuous economical problems and attempts to fix the economy by extorting money from Russia through threatening to gas transit routes and energy safety of Europe.

‚ùóÔ∏èRussia is not trying to use food supplies as weapon. Withdrawal from the grain deal was the result of outrageous terrorist attack on Russian Black Sea fleet at the port of Sevastopol that was staged under cover of the ‚Äúgrain corridor‚Äù. 

‚ûñRussian Ministry of defense has analyzed data from navigation modules of captured underwater drones and this analysis confirmed that the drones were launched from the coast near Odessa and were moving along the ‚Äúsafe corridor‚Äù established under the ‚Äúgrain deal‚Äù and then changed their course and moved on to attack Russian fleet. 

‚ûñSince the ‚Äúgrain deal‚Äù was used to cover hostile military activities, it means that initiators of this attack have broken the deal and rendered it invalid. Russian Ministry of Defense announced that it has solid proof of involvement of Ukraine and UK in the attack and Russia has officially requested a Security Council meeting on the matter.

‚ûñIt's worth noting that possible UK involvement in Black Sea attack as well as in North Stream attack that could be executed with similar drones may result in dire escalation of the conflict. The West has dismissed all accusations and evidence, following its traditional pattern of behavior, and this makes the present situation very alarming. 

‚ûñRussia would not come up with public accusations without proof and high confidence in actual involvement of the British in this terrorist attacks. However, if the West will just ignore the accusations and proofs, Russia will face a dangerous dilemma. If Russia ignores possible involvement of UK in the incident and will let it go without consequences, it will encourage further actions of this kind. On the other hand, any response may be considered an act of aggression against NATO country and ultimately result in next world war.

‚ûñ Anatoly Antonov, Russian ambassador in the U.S. has commented on the matter and on accusations in weaponizing the food deal: 

‚ÄúWashington's reaction to the terrorist attack on the port of Sevastopol is truly outrageous. We have not seen any signs of condemnation of the reckless actions by the Kiev regime. Instead, all the indications that the British military specialists were involved in organizing today's massive strike with the use of drones, are disregarded.
 The situation has escalated even further. But in the U.S., they do not intend to acknowledge this. Again, everything is reduced to false accusations that our country is exacerbating the global food problem. In the face of attacks and provocations against Russian military and merchant vessels involved in the ‚ÄúBlack Sea Initiative‚Äù, we cannot turn a blind eye to security issues and continue working. It is unfair to condemn Russia in suspending the implementation of the deal. This happened because of the reckless actions by the Ukrainian authorities‚Äù.
Russia has already announced that it will supply 500,000 tons of its own grain to poorest countries of Africa free of charge. Considering the fact that a large part of Ukrainian grain that was exported under the ‚Äúgrain deal‚Äù ended up in European countries, this could mean that countries that really need this grain will get even more than they could expect. 

‚ûñAnatoly Antonov put it this way: ‚ÄúAs for the insinuations about ‚Äúprovoking‚Äù hunger, we would like to remind you of our repeated calls to send food shipments, first of all, to countries in need. Instead, however, a good half of all carriers under the ‚Äúgrain deal‚Äù went to developed countries. While Somalia, Ethiopia, Yemen, Sudan and Afghanistan received only about 3% of the volume of agricultural products‚Äù.

‚ûñThe current grain deal is over. Ukrainian attack staged by its Western sponsors has ruined it. Russia could possibly discuss a possibility of a new grain deal but it will need much better guarantees and it will be very hard to convince Russia to resume it. And firstly, before any talks take place the West really got to explain involvement of the United Kingdom in the incidents.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2432.0,18.0,2022-10-31T08:59:24+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,91.0,MessageEntityItalic,2020.0,1257.0,MessageEntityItalic,3309.0,380.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,389.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,389.0,,,,,MessageReplies,7.0,25478.0,False,[],,13785.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

‚ûñ These sanctions are based on legal acts adopted by European Council. While these acts have been drafted and approved in accordance with proper EU procedures, the very substantiation of these acts lacks factual proof and is based on perception.

‚ùóÔ∏èFor example, the EU substantiates ban of Russian media outlets with the following statement: ‚ÄúThe Russian Federation has engaged in a systematic, international campaign of disinformation, information manipulation and distortion of facts in order to enhance its strategy of destabilising both its neighbouring countries and the EU and its member states. The state-owned and pro-Kremlin disinformation outlets are essential and instrumental in supporting Russia‚Äôs aggression against Ukraine. They constitute a significant and direct threat to the EU‚Äôs public order and security. This is why the EU has decided to sanction the Kremlin‚Äôs disinformation and information manipulation assets‚Äù.

‚ûñThis entire statement is full of controversial, unverified and biased statements. First of all, there has been no single proof of any disinformation, manipulation of distortion of facts by sources linked with the government of the Russian Federation. Such statements should at least be based on results of impartial investigation verified by objective and impartial court. Without such substantiation these statements can be legally classified as slander and defamation of the Russian Federation and specific media. 

‚ûñSecond, any statements about Russian ‚Äústrategy‚Äù are groundless since official strategies are publicly known and worded by responsible officials of the government of the Russian Federation. This whole part has no substantiation except for words of those who have drafted this statement and their perception or imagination. Use of such statements can also be classified as slander and defamation of the Russian Federation and the Russian government.

‚ûñThird, use of epithets such as ‚Äúdisinformation outlets‚Äù and ‚Äúaggression‚Äù is misleading by itself, especially since no cases of disinformation have been proven or verified and mention of ‚Äúaggression‚Äù absolutely ignores circumstances surrounding the Ukrainian conflict. They have been used without any grounds and also constitute an act of slander and defamation. 

‚ûñFourth, ‚Äúdirect threat to the EU‚Äôs public order and security‚Äù can be classified as providing false information knowingly. The special operation of Russian Armed Forces in Ukraine and its coverage in Russian official media does not and cannot constitute any direct or indirect threat to public order and security of the European Union. 

‚ûñFifth, all of the above would not justify closure of Russian media outlets without proper court procedures and giving them the right to defend itself. However, the European Council has circumvented this requirement by specifically drafting a new legal act that is officially based on unsubstantiated claims. This whole procedure contradicts the very concept of justice and proves arbitrary and dictatorial nature of the European Council.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2530.0,12.0,2022-10-28T11:02:38+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,76.0,MessageEntityItalic,418.0,595.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,386.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,386.0,,,,,MessageReplies,6.0,25478.0,False,[],,14069.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

‚õîÔ∏è Ukraine is not fighting for its freedom. Ukraine is not an independent state to begin with. The status of Ukraine can be defined as a client state, a puppet state and/or a proxy colony. 

üî∑ Client state is defined a country that gets support and protection from another larger and more powerful country. Ever since 2014 Ukraine has been a client state of the United States of America and to lesser extent the European Union, which itself can be considered a client entity of the U.S.A. Those entities provided Ukraine financial support in form of loans and protection in form of military aid. 

üî∑ A note on client state status of the European Union. European Union does receive military support and military protection from the United States of America and hosts a large number of U.S. or U.S.-controlled military bases. Permanent presence of U.S. soldiers on European soil and especially in Germany causes doubts about the very status of EU as an independent entity.

üî∑ A puppet state is a state with a government which is endowed with the outward symbols of authority but in which direction and control are exercised by another power. Ever since 2014 Ukraine has been puppet state of the United States of America. Natural interests of Ukrainian state have been ignored in favor of geopolitical interests of its puppeteer. 

üî∑A proxy colony is a formally independent country that is directly or indirectly controlled by a stronger country for the sole benefit of the controller, usually economic benefit. Ukrainian economy was not in best state by the time of 2014 coup, but ever since that time Ukrainian government cared not about benefit of Ukrainian people but about profits of its hegemon and promoting its interests with the aim to create a military threat on Russian border and reduce the influence of the Russian Federation.

üî∑ So, why are Ukrainians not fighting for their freedom? Because dependent country can fight for its freedom only against its master. A puppet state can fight for its freedom only when it fights against its puppeteer. If Ukrainians fought against NATO to throw them out of their country, they would really fight for the freedom of Ukraine. Instead, the puppet regime of Zelensky is fighting for the slavery of Ukraine, not for its freedom. Until Ukrainians return their independence, saying that they fight for freedom would be a mockery.
Ironically, while Ukrainians fight for continuing their own slavery, Russia fights for liberating them from their masters and their government puppets who have fooled a large part of Ukrainian people with propagandist lies and deliberately worked for years to bring the wedge between brotherly Russian and Ukrainian nations‚Ä¶",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2058.0,12.0,2022-10-27T18:03:05+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,92.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,384.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,384.0,,,,,MessageReplies,4.0,25478.0,False,[],,13586.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

‚ûñThere have been no big developments in the conflict in October except for commencement of Russian missile strikes at Ukrainian energy grid that brought its capacity down. All Ukrainian attempts to break the front at Kherson region were futile and it is unclear whether they will launch a massive assault as it was originally thought. Russia is about to finish evacuation of civilians from Kherson and keeps reinforcing its positions and troops in the area. 

‚ûñAccording to reports, after several failed attempts of assaulting Russian positions in Kupiansk area Ukraine is shifting forces from Kharkov region to Zaporozhye region. Recent news say that Ukrainian forces are fortifying industrial facilities, setting firing points in schools, hospitals and kindergartens and preparing human shields in the city of Zaporozhye planning to turn it into another Mariupol. 

‚ûñMeanwhile, Russian forces keep pressure on Ukrainian fortified positions in Donbass and are repealing all attempts of counteroffensive inflicting casualties on the opposite side. Artemovsk seems to be still partially held by the Ukrainian side although most of the city already went under control of Russian forces. 

‚ûñThe conflict is still lingering on because despite numerical superiority and Western weapons Ukraine keeps failing to start offensive operations, while Russia is slowly reinforcing its forces and waiting for the arrival of all mobilized forces and volunteers to the front lines to resume offensive operations. 

‚ûñThis pause could be a good time to resume peace negotiations but Ukraine dismissed the idea and is now slowly drifting to its failure. The only place where Ukraine is winning are headlines of Ukrainian and Western media. 

‚ûñActual situation in Ukraine is dire. The entire country suffers from damage to power grid, Ukrainian economy is in complete shambles and survives only because of continuous inflow of money from the European Union and the United States.

‚ûñThis Tuesday President of the European Commission (EC), Ursula von der Leyen has publicly announced ‚ÄúOur goal is not just to freeze, but to seize the assets‚Äù with regard to funds belonging to Russian individuals including Russian Central Bank that are currently frozen in European jurisdiction. She stated that EU is setting up a work group to ‚Äúestablish of the legal framework‚Äù for confiscation of Russian assets. 

‚ûñWhat does it mean? It means that we are entering a new era in EU history when Europe invents new laws and twists existing laws to justify what can be seen solely as theft. This initiative will create a dangerous precedent that will deal a tremendous blow to trust of any non-European investors in Europe could even raise concerns among common European people. 

‚ûñIf EU can make up laws to seize Russian money, what prevents it from making laws to seize money of some OPEC billionaires, Chinese investors and even European own banks on its own discretion? They surely think that this action is justified and they are probably really planning to use the money for the aid to Ukraine. However, an outsider can view it as arbitrary and biased decision way outside the jurisdiction of EU. 

‚ûñIf they can give Russian money to Ukraine, why can‚Äôt they give Saudi money to Yemen or Chinese money to Dalai Lama? Moreover, if they think that Orban is not democratic enough, what prevents them from giving Hungarian money to Poland, which is more ‚Äúdemocratic‚Äù? 

‚ûñWhy is it happening now? First of all, it is about mirror measures that Russia can take in retaliations. By now most European companies have withdrawn from Russia, and left their assets under management of their local partners. This gives Russia little options to apply identical measures, especially because those companies that are still operating in Russia are in fact proving that they are truly impartial and won‚Äôt abandon Russia in hard time. This is worth a lot, so any actions against such companies would be unwise. This does not leave more opportunities for mirrored measures, but Russia is well known for its asymmetric responses so something will surely come when time is right. 

‚ûñThe second reason for this initiative is that Ukrainian president Zelensky keeps asking EU and everyone else for money. He needs money to pay soldiers, he needs money to run the country, he needs money to rebuild infrastructure, or he just needs money. It seems that the money that the West pours into Ukraine disappear within a blink of an eye, as Zelensky keeps asking for more, and more, and more. Sustaining a bankrupt country that tries to engage in military action against a superior opponent is a costly pleasure. 

‚ûñThe third reason for this initiative is directly related to the second one. It seems that EU is running out of spare money. It seems that at least some EU countries are not that eager to allocate a part of their budgets to keep Zelensky‚Äôs drowning ship afloat. Anti-Russian sanctions did cost EU dearly and continuous aid to Ukraine creates yet another burden. Considering the fact that it is highly likely that the U.S. will reduce its own volume of aid, EU will become the main Ukrainian sponsor. In light of energy crisis, unprecedented inflation and imminent economic recession they are naturally looking for extra sources of money. 

‚ûñHowever, it is unlikely that this initiative will result in anything big except immediate termination of all remaining gas supplies from Russia. Russian assets will disappear in the black hole of Ukraine in a matter of short time and EU will face the same situation or even worse. One thing is for sure ‚Äì winter is coming.

Long-term economic benefits in form of arms industry expansion will be seen only in several years, geopolitical benefits in form of weaking Russia are not material, and influx of investments running away from Europe benefits Wall Street but not common Americans.

‚ûñContinued U.S. support of Ukraine is vital for the outcome of this conflict. Biden‚Äôs refusal to negotiate with Russia directly shows that his administration bets on continuation and escalation of war. Most military experts throughout the world agree that without U.S. support Ukraine will collapse in a matter of a month or two. The country is totally bankrupt and its military is totally dependent on Western supplies of weapons and ammunitions. 

üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è American people rightfully think that this conflict doesn‚Äôt concern them and are unhappy about huge volumes of aid to Ukraine while local economy is very close to recession that can potentially result in an economical crisis of the scale not yet seen this century. They rightfully think that government should show them real results instead of media stories about Ukrainian successes and Russian defeats. Especially when these stories aren‚Äôt based on any actual achievements. While many Americans still blindly believe the propaganda about Russian weakness and brag about their swift victories in Iraq, even those Americans still think that Russia and U.S need to talk and improve relations and that Ukraine is largely irrelevant for the U.S.

‚ùå No. Europeans have to thank their governments for things they will have to suffer. Sanctions against Russia have been implemented solely by the decision of European governments. Expecting continued supplies in the environment of total economical war against Russia was more than just wishful thinking. 

‚ûñNaturally, Russia was trying to work out a solution with its former European partners, and the parties were negotiating at least some exemptions for Nord Stream pipelines. However, as negotiations started to progress, a ‚Äúmysterious‚Äù explosion ruined them for the time being. In fact, even if Russia wanted to ‚Äúturn on‚Äù gas, it wouldn‚Äôt be possible at the moment. 

‚ûñIt‚Äôs worth noting that Ukrainian pipeline and Belarusian-Polish pipeline are still working, so Europe is still receiving natural gas from Russia, which would be quite surprising news for most Europeans. Especially in light of the fact that Poland decided to nationalize local Russian gas operator and its property without any compensation to Gazprom. 

‚ûñBesides, there is another important factor. American folks need job and American investors need profit, and the moral duty of Europeans is to help them and buy American LNG at fair market prices in addition to ordering more weapons from the US to replenish their stocks that got depleted because of helping Ukraine.
It sounds ridiculous, but it seems that Europeans really believe in that and are really ready to sacrifice themselves for American well-being and the objective of continued escalation and extension of Ukrainian conflict. 

‚ûñEven prior to energy shortages, there have already been major frictions and protests in Europe. The addiction to giving the energy market to the spot market (speculation) means that energy pricing spirals, not based on Russian actions but on all the comments of EU officials who want to rid themselves of Russian energy. Effectively, the EU was already committing economic suicide, and then a ‚Äúmysterious party‚Äù helped them by blowing up Nord Stream.

‚ûñIt is ludicrous that even now, it is impossible to say the obvious: ‚Äúlet‚Äôs get rid of all Russian sanctions‚Äù, which is the only sensible way out of this economic circling of the drain. Russia is economically doing just fine. Houses are warm, people are enjoying cold and hot water without any restrictions, energy saving is a choice and not a duty. Car fuel is inexpensive, new factories are opening and reopening every week. Judging by the looks, Russia managed to avoid economic crisis and its citizens won‚Äôt face any deprivations except for missing ‚ÄúMc‚Äù in McMuffin.

‚ûñEuropean ‚Äúgood news‚Äù about being prepared for the winter aren‚Äôt very objective. When they say that 95% of their reserves are full, they actually mean 25% of the yearly need. However, those underground reserves need an ongoing pressure and thermal stability from Nord Stream in order to get the gas up into the distribution. Engineering studies now show that without the massive pressure of Nord Stream, creating upward pressure and thermal stability for the gas reserves, a minimum of 30% of the gas reserves will not be accessible, while many accidents will happen that may impede the functionality of the gas reserves as they succumb to thermal instability. 

‚ûñProblems with gas in Germany and some other parts of Europe will likely manifest in mid December. There will be very little energy to light the Christmas trees or fireworks for the beginning of 2023, which may be the worst year since WW2 for Europe. 

‚ùîAre Russians to blame for this? Well, Europeans can blame Russians all they want or they can try and elect some reasonable people for once. Their politicians can continue telling fairy tales about immediate transition to green energy, but these fairy tales will bring Europe to its darkest night.
Do Russians want Europeans to suffer? No, we don‚Äôt. But it‚Äôs not our problem. Europe created problems for itself and now they have to work a way out.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,6048.0,30.0,2022-10-25T19:48:47+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,73.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,376.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,376.0,,,,,MessageReplies,32.0,25478.0,False,[],,13806.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Is it possible? What about WTO rules?

‚ùìSue where? In US court? In US-controlled international court? Since there is no independent and impartial forum, this legislation won‚Äôt result in anything meaningful. It will be just same usual US approach, applying their own legislation and jurisdiction over the entire world.

üî∑It all boils down to usual threats and pressure on OPEC nations to make them act in US interests instead of their own interests. OPEC is quite a loose organization and US has influence over many of its members. Yes, Biden managed to spoil US relations with Saudi Arabia, but the U.S. still can push the Arab countries hard.

üî∑Even a threat of sanctions like those applied to Russia will make them do whatever U.S. says. Especially considering the fact that most OPEC billionaires store their wealth in the West.
Anti-Russian sanctions made the whole third world worry about their capitals and investments in the Western world. That created a very bad precedent and they just can‚Äôt be sure that such sanctions won‚Äôt be applied to them. For example, tomorrow US might ‚Äúnotice‚Äù that there is a war going on in Yemen, accuse Saudi Arabia of aggression and impose all imaginable sanctions against it. As for the issue of ‚Äúhuman rights‚Äù, no country can be safe from accusations here.

üî∑Now we come to WTO. In case with Russia, sanctions aren‚Äôt compliant with WTO rules or rather WTO objective to ‚Äúopen the markets and ensure stable, safe, transparent and predictable trade relations‚Äù.

üî∑Russia had strong opposition to WTO because its rules were detrimental for restoration of national industry and reduced its competitiveness on the global market. Yet, Russia still formally remains a WTO member althought it‚Äôs now a liability, not a benefit and it seems that WTO rules are ignored when applied to Russia.

üî∑This was true about all sanctions that were placed on Russia ever since December 2012 (and Russia entered WTO only in August 2012 after many years of negotiations and national legislation reforms).

üî∑Yes, article 21 of WTO charter provides WTO members the right to implement sanctions ‚Äúin the interests of national security‚Äù, but this article is too broad and doesn‚Äôt provide any specific scope of those ‚Äúinterests‚Äù. For example, it‚Äôs hard to see how any Russian actions in Europe impact US national security interests (in traditional sense). They could be perceived as impacting national security interests of EU countries, but it‚Äôs still too loose.
While it maybe can be applied to 2022 sanctions, it wasn‚Äôt applicable to 2012 sanctions, 2014 sanctions and all other sanction packages up to February 2022. 

üî∑To sum it up, yes, US can introduce any laws and try to enforce compliance with those laws. They will probably find a weak point and some OPEC members will back off and do whatever US says. However, this won‚Äôt make US actions legal. 

üî∑Yes, there are antitrust rules and laws, but they can be applied only in relevant jurisdictions.

üî∑ Naturally, the easiest way out would be to start purchasing cheap energy in Russia once again. It won‚Äôt end the crisis immediately but will stop its expansion and will bring mid-term improvements. However, such action would have serious political consequences.

There is always a chance but it will not be easy for those countries. 

üî∑ One should not forget that sanctions are not unilateral. Russia has also implemented sanctions against Western countries. Countries that have imposed sanctions upon Russia are now considered unfriendly countries and trade with these countries is restricted. If some country would like to go back to trading with Russia, this country has to withdraw its own sanctions and negotiate removal from the list with Russia. 

üî∑ Such scenario looks unlikely now and implies that this hypothetical country goes against overall policy of the Western bloc. When the Ukrainian crisis is over, chances will get better. However, everything will depend on the policy of the United States of America and their own desire to maintain sanctions and trade with Russia. 

üî∑ The volume of trade between US and Russia has always been low as compared to their trade with other countries. Russia is not even in top 20 of main US trade partners. EU was the main trade partner of the Russian Federation with China holding a firm second place. However, if we speak about individual countries and not about EU, China has no competitors here.

üî∑ Top three Russian trade partners in 2021 were China (17.9%), Germany (7.3%) and Netherlands (5.9%). Looking at their own statistics, we can see that Russia is not that important for China (2.1% of Chinese export), while US is as important as China is for Russia (17.1% of Chinese export goes to US). Export to Russia is not relevant for Germany, Russia is not even in top ten of German export destinations. The same is true about Netherlands.

üî∑ Looking at those statistics it seems unlikely that any Western country has really serious incentives to go back to trading with Russia. However, statistics is one thing and reality in the other thing. Looking at the statistics, it would be impossible to predict the devastating impact of anti-Russian sanctions on European economies. 

üî∑ Why was that impact so noticeable? Because import-export flows are a complicated thing and Russia and Europe did have strong economical ties and were interdependent. 

üî∑ Import-export statistics does not account for subsidiaries of foreign companies that operated in Russia and have now withdrawn from the country leaving behind their production facilities. Import-export statistics does not account for dependence of European industry on cheap Russian energy, which was the main factor that made it competitive. Termination of cheap energy supplies increased production costs and caused a chain reaction that hasn‚Äôt yet manifested in full. 

üî∑ Although Europe is able to get energy from alternative sources, there is one big factor that makes it irrelevant ‚Äî this energy is not cheap. Increased energy costs result in increased production costs, which manifest in inflation, devaluation of currency and further increase of energy costs. Industries become less competitive and are forced to reduce production. This results in loss of jobs and increased unemployment, which creates another burden for state budgets‚Ä¶",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,2876.0,6.0,2022-10-24T15:28:05+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,87.0,MessageEntityBold,419.0,164.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,369.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,369.0,,,,,MessageReplies,2.0,25478.0,False,[],,14079.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

‚úîÔ∏è The investigation is already over. Investigators from Germany, Sweden, Denmark and Poland have worked on it for a few weeks. 

‚ûñ Swedish seismologists were the first to report several explosions near the pipelines on the evening of September 26, raising suspicions of sabotage. Although Sweden cooperated with investigators, the Swedish side has officially declared ‚Äúinformation in the investigation is subject to confidentiality and directly linked to national security‚Äù. 

‚ûñ It is worth noting that a similar incident occurred in 2015 when Swedish defense forces have discovered an underwater drone loaded with explosive ordnance near the site of North Stream pipeline. The control wire of that drone was cut and nothing has happened back then, but the investigation still ended with nothing ‚Äì no public information about suspects or those responsible.  
It remains unclear who was behind the explosions, but the chief suspects were claimed Russia, the US, Ukraine and Poland. 

‚òùÔ∏èRussia has blamed the US and denied any involvement in blowing up its own multi-billion dollar pipelines, although technically the pipelines belong to Germany. Considering the fact that German officials have already mentioned that they know who is responsible and reluctance of Swedish government to get involved in the matter (both quoting national security interests), it is becoming obvious that the responsible party is not Russia. 

‚òùÔ∏è Poland and Ukraine could be involved if this attack was also done with underwater drones and did not require use of submarines. However, there has been unconfirmed and unofficial information that 2015 attempt of attack was done by US UUVRON I drone and that evidences of this attack also exist. Only three of the four lines has been destroyed, so it is quite possible that there is one more explosive unit somewhere around. Maybe it has already been found. 

Julien Philippe, French blogger and geopolitics expert is confident that no matter who did the act, the real blame goes to the United States of America: 
We just need to answer a few simple questions:

‚Äî Did the USA support the Euro-Russian energy ties ? No.

‚Äî Did Russia kept selling gas to the EU after the EU sanctions were announced then enforced? Yes.

‚Äî Did the USA threaten NS2 and blamed Germany for it, while taking by proxy punitive measures on NS1 as well? Yes.

‚Äî Do the USA have interest for those pipes to be ‚Äúsecurely‚Äù offline for a long while to bring the EU into dependence to the USA and their fossil-fuel rich client states? Yes.

‚Äî Is Russia more interested to make a PR stunt over the idle pipes than to keep them available for a desirable future? On the short-term, yes, but on the long term, no: 4D chess or normal chess game, it‚Äôs undecided.

‚Äî Could the USA have itself plotted the perfect alibi for Russia to be blamed for a perfect false flag ? Well, the CIA has nothing to envy to the KGB. Undecided.

Then, is Russia more in trouble if it‚Äôs found guilty than the USA? Likely yes, Russia bets on reliability in its global order reshaping, while the USA just bet on being global bullies.

Ultimately, did the USA or Russia led us there, by their policies aiming at the other guy, non-withstanding the amount of damage such policies can do? My vote goes to the USA, definitively.

And that‚Äôs the ultimate point of my opinion:

‚òÖ‚Äî To begin with, the part of the world that does most for the Ukrainians is the Russian Federation. Besides fighting to save the ukrainians from the nationalist oppression, she is already spending more money on restoring housing and industrial facilities in the part of the Ukraine she is controlling ($52 billion) than any other country in the world has spent on sending means of destruction to the Kiev regime (the US has allotted $55 billion, the European Union $48 billion). The Kiev neo-Nazi regime, not the Ukrainians, is not at all supported by most of the world, neither whether you mean territory nor population. Or those that are governed by the governments of the Republic of India and the People's Republic of China have lately shrunk so dramatically to become less? (Not noting the American, Italian, Brazilian Venezuelan, Syrian and other volunteers who came to the Ukraine to fight against the neo-nazi unconstitutional regime of Kiev; neither noting the British, American, South African, French and other journalists who denounce the unconstitutional Kiev regime.) The question why is your ""most of the world"" took sides with what you call the Ukrainians is too easily answered: they did it long ago. Since the breakup of the Soviet Union in early in the 1990s, the West, determined to prevent Russia from becoming strong again, did what it could to foster anti-Russian sentiment and forces in the Ukraine. While Russia supported the Ukrainian economy with cheap credit,  cheap mineral oil and gas, and by buying the most technological produce of the Ukrainian industry (which the westerners were not eager to buy at all).",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,2022-10-24T01:07:05+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,1.0,59.0,MessageEntityItalic,1.0,59.0,MessageEntityBold,263.0,10.0,MessageEntityBold,438.0,20.0,MessageEntityBold,594.0,3.0,MessageEntityUnderline,594.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReplyHeader,11000.0,,10381.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Message,13004,1639836943,2022-10-22T14:20:44+00:00,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"ü§î Why did the West turn its back on Putin when he (following 9/11) stretched out a hand and suggested that we cooperate in combating terrorism and even suggested that both Russia and the West might benefit from Russia joining NATO?

Because Putin‚Äôs advances were not like he begged to take Russia in. He offered partnership. From Western point of view I see a number of possible problems:

1Ô∏è‚É£Firstly, Putin wanted Russia to play a role that would fit Russia as the largest country in the world with second strong military without consideration of Russian economy as evaluated by the West. Not just another NATO member, but an equal to the U.S.
The U.S. naturally did not want to concede any of its powers and did not want a potential challenger in its own military block.

2Ô∏è‚É£Secondly, terrorism was too small and insignificant target for the scale of NATO. Fighting terrorism is a task for Interpol. Using violent tactics to prevent terrorist attacks just creates more sources of terrorism. ISIS emerged as a natural consequences of invasion of Iraq.

NATO clearly understood it, so they needed an enemy to justify their existence. If an alliance does not have enemies, people may question its usefulness. Fortunately for the West, newly added NATO members from the Eastern Europe gave them an enemy.

Most post-communist states that entered NATO were ruled by nationalistic anti-communist elites and their agenda was heavily based on the idea of ‚ÄúSoviet occupation‚Äù. They saw (and see) Russia responsible for whatever USSR did, so anti-Russian sentiments became a noticeable part of their national ideologies.

I don‚Äôt know if they were serious when they were saying they are afraid of Russian invasion (they say it even now, but they also said it back in 1990s when Russia was in shambles).

Choosing Russia as the main enemy was reasonable because of numerous factors. First of all, this would solidify NATO membership of Eastern European countries. They wouldn‚Äôt challenge the U.S. and object against adding Russia to NATO if the U.S. chose this course. However, this would greatly reduce their enthusiasm about NATO and they would see no sense in staying.

Anyway, China was not yet a challenger to U.S. but still was economically stronger than Russia, so the U.S. saw it best to increase pressure on Russia, deprive Russia of all influence in neighboring countries and prevent all chances of Russian economical restoration back to USSR level and beyond it.

3Ô∏è‚É£Thirdly, there were technical difficulties. Reforming Russian army to NATO standards and NATO equipment would essentially be equivalent to reforming U.S. army to Soviet standards. A massive and pointless project. This means that NATO would have to adapt its standards for Russian arms and military specifics. As the result U.S. defense industry would see emerging competitor within their own military bloc, and that was unacceptable for the U.S.

4Ô∏è‚É£Fourthly, NATO with Russia would not have any challengers and this would make its existence pointless.

So, we see that NATO membership for Russia was indeed impossible. What about partnership? Yes, partnership was possible and it existed. Many of the above-listed factors played against this partnership but it was Russian desire to have sovereign policies that made the split inevitable.

Continued and increasing pressure of the United States of America on post-Soviet countries through a web of NGOs and US-trained politicians created numerous problems in countries bordering Russia and Russia could not ignore those problems.
These hostile actions were the core reason for alienation between Russia and NATO and nullified all chances to expand partnership.

With time Russian rhetorics changed, just as rhetorics of NATO and the United States. Last year Russian President finally decided to raise an issue that was bothering all Russian people for over 20 years - the issue of NATO expansion to Russian borders.

Russia did send an ultimatum to NATO. It was rejected. Masks went off. Dismissal of the ultimatum opened the way for a new Cold War or even a hot one.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,8434.0,75.0,2022-10-22T14:28:06+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,231.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,366.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,366.0,,,,,MessageReplies,9.0,25478.0,False,[],,13104.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since 2016, they have trained the Ukrainian military to conduct combat operations in cities - storming buildings, cleaning, fighting in urban areas. Even then, the West was preparing them for the fact that there would be urban battles.

The fact is not new. The news only reminds us that they planned the Ukrainian conflict and prepared it many years ago. Kiev was inflated with weapons, military training was conducted, massive propaganda works on the Ukrainian population - all this replaced negotiations and possible agreements. The peaceful resolution of the issue was not implied either then or today, and all Kiev's statements about readiness for negotiations are fiction and farce. 

Could it have been otherwise? Could hundreds of thousands of lives, laid down in the odious struggle of the US against Russia, have been saved? They could, if Kiev had patriotic leaders, whose aim was to preserve the integrity of the state, its development and prosperity of its people, rather than to plunder the country, focusing mindlessly on joining the European Union and crazy ambitions and dreams of friendship with the leading world powers, who, as it turned out, consider Ukraine a bargaining chip, and not a full-fledged ally.

Hopefully they aren‚Äôt. 

‚ûñHopefully, those Americans fully believe the picture presented by their mainstream media and think that Ukraine has no nazis (or rather ‚Äúevery country has some skinheads‚Äù), that Ukraine did not commit any atrocities in its civil war in Donbass and Russian intervention was not justified. 

‚ûñIf American people really knew how things were, if they were shown hundreds of factual materials, interviews with witnesses of those crimes, testimonies of captured Azov terrorists, they hopefully would not have any sympathies to this radical neo-Nazi group that was allowed to run loose, run autonomous military operations, terrorize civilian population, promote their ideology among children and do many other things that are absolutely against any human norms. 

‚ûñHopefully, people of America and Western Europe who are condemning Russia for its intervention simply don‚Äôt know the real situation, they don‚Äôt know what forces was Russia standing against. Had they really known, really seen that the Ukrainian government (at best) allowed neo-Nazis to run loose and left their crimes unpunished, that the Ukrainian government promoted radical nationalist ideology, that the Ukrainian government was really ready for genocide in Donbass, I think that they would change their mind. 

‚ûñIn fact, knowing that people in the U.S. and Western Europe do have strong sense of justice and endorse their governments to fight against oppressive governments turning against the people of their countries, if they really knew the real situation, they would request their leaders not just to stay neutral but to help Russia clean Ukraine of the poison of nazism. 
It is impossible to imagine that any reasonable and law-abiding person in the modern world who lives in a democratic and tolerant country could ever support the neo-Nazi groups and their apologists. Many people see the world as black and white and condemn Russia because of that, but it‚Äôs hard to imagine how could they see groups like Azov as ‚Äúwhite‚Äù. 

‚ûñUkrainian supporters keep saying that it‚Äôs absurd because Zelensky is Jewish and therefore there are no nazis in Ukraine. First of all, nazism is not equivalent to antisemitism. Nazism is about theories of superiority of a specific ethnic group over others. In this case, it manifests as radical Ukrainian nationalism that puts Ukraine above all and calls to eliminate the group that poses greatest danger for this radical nationalism ‚Äî Russian-speaking population of Ukraine. Zelensky‚Äôs government supported this ideas by enacting discriminative laws against use of Russian language. 

‚ûñIt‚Äôs worth noting that maybe Zelensky is not a follower of neo-Nazis and maybe he could even turned against them but they were too powerful for him to risk that. Maybe Zelensky was sincere in his electoral promises and really wanted to become the president of peace. However, harsh reality is that radical nationalists provided force support to 2014 Maidan in Ukraine and gained a lot of power and influence in the country since that time.

Diese Ma√ünahme wird vermutlich Einrichtungen betreffen, die sich auf dem Territorium, das ‚Äûf√ºr die Sicherheit des Staates wichtig ist‚Äú, befinden. Sie wird nur in dem Fall eingef√ºhrt, ""wenn die Gefahr festgestellt und begr√ºndet wird"". Der Minister hat nicht angegeben, welche Gebiete als ‚Äûwichtig f√ºr die Sicherheit‚Äú gelten und welche Gr√ºnde f√ºr die Einf√ºhrung einer solchen diskriminierenden Ma√ünahme dahinterstehen sollen. Er f√ºgte jedoch hinzu, dass das Land √ºber ein Instrument f√ºr eine solche Beschlagnahme verf√ºgt.

In diesem Zusammenhang sei daran erinnert, dass man Ende August in Finnland begann, bei der Einreise in die Russische F√∂deration das Bargeld von den Russen in Euro zu beschlagnahmen. Und Ende September k√ºndigte das finnische Au√üenministerium die Schlie√üung der Grenze f√ºr russische Touristen an, obwohl der Entzug des Rechts auf die Freiz√ºgigkeit gegen das EU-Recht verst√∂√üt. Vorher haben Estland, Lettland, Litauen und Polen diese diskriminierende Ma√ünahme ergriffen. In Deutschland geht man in dieser Frage noch vern√ºnftiger vor: Visas werden erteilt, aber die Anforderungen f√ºr ihre Ausstellung sind in letzter Zeit deutlich versch√§rft worden. Insbesondere m√ºssen Sie jetzt, um ein Visum zu erhalten, einen Auszug aus der in der EU t√§tigen Bank vorlegen und die Zahlung f√ºr die gebuchte Unterkunft best√§tigen.

Hopefully they aren‚Äôt. 

‚ûñHopefully, those Americans fully believe the picture presented by their mainstream media and think that Ukraine has no nazis (or rather ‚Äúevery country has some skinheads‚Äù), that Ukraine did not commit any atrocities in its civil war in Donbass and Russian intervention was not justified. 

‚ûñIf American people really knew how things were, if they were shown hundreds of factual materials, interviews with witnesses of those crimes, testimonies of captured Azov terrorists, they hopefully would not have any sympathies to this radical neo-Nazi group that was allowed to run loose, run autonomous military operations, terrorize civilian population, promote their ideology among children and do many other things that are absolutely against any human norms. 

‚ûñHopefully, people of America and Western Europe who are condemning Russia for its intervention simply don‚Äôt know the real situation, they don‚Äôt know what forces was Russia standing against. Had they really known, really seen that the Ukrainian government (at best) allowed neo-Nazis to run loose and left their crimes unpunished, that the Ukrainian government promoted radical nationalist ideology, that the Ukrainian government was really ready for genocide in Donbass, I think that they would change their mind. 

‚ûñIn fact, knowing that people in the U.S. and Western Europe do have strong sense of justice and endorse their governments to fight against oppressive governments turning against the people of their countries, if they really knew the real situation, they would request their leaders not just to stay neutral but to help Russia clean Ukraine of the poison of nazism. 
It is impossible to imagine that any reasonable and law-abiding person in the modern world who lives in a democratic and tolerant country could ever support the neo-Nazi groups and their apologists. Many people see the world as black and white and condemn Russia because of that, but it‚Äôs hard to imagine how could they see groups like Azov as ‚Äúwhite‚Äù. 

‚ûñUkrainian supporters keep saying that it‚Äôs absurd because Zelensky is Jewish and therefore there are no nazis in Ukraine. First of all, nazism is not equivalent to antisemitism. Nazism is about theories of superiority of a specific ethnic group over others. In this case, it manifests as radical Ukrainian nationalism that puts Ukraine above all and calls to eliminate the group that poses greatest danger for this radical nationalism ‚Äî Russian-speaking population of Ukraine. Zelensky‚Äôs government supported this ideas by enacting discriminative laws against use of Russian language. 

‚ûñIt‚Äôs worth noting that maybe Zelensky is not a follower of neo-Nazis and maybe he could even turned against them but they were too powerful for him to risk that. Maybe Zelensky was sincere in his electoral promises and really wanted to become the president of peace. However, harsh reality is that radical nationalists provided force support to 2014 Maidan in Ukraine and gained a lot of power and influence in the country since that time. Their positions were strong and Zelensky couldn‚Äôt do much about that even if he wanted. However, even firm condemnation of neo-Nazi activities by Zelensky would be enough and would probably prevent Russian intervention.

For many years and even decades oil & gas export to the West has been one of the most important aspects for Russian budget. Russia received money and used this money to import many products and technologies from the Western countries, as well as for investment purposes. However, things have greatly changed ever since the West decided to economically isolate itself from Russia. 

Now, when Russia sells oil & gas to Western countries, it receives currency of those Western countries. Previously this currency stayed on foreign accounts and was used for the above purposes. Now these accounts are frozen and customers transfer it to Russian banks where it is exchanged for rubles. 

Now, there is a big question that has very simple answer. What is the difference between restricted emission of rubles and sale of resources to the West? The difference is that Russia keeps those resources and the West doesn‚Äôt get those resources.

Russia does not need any foreign currency because it has foreign trade proficit even without any export from the West. Remaining Russian gold and currency reserves are sufficient to balance the difference even if import volumes start increasing.

So, now only IMF rules prevent Russia from monetizing its economy, which has a chronic deficit of money for many years. 
However, if Russia decided to dump its dependence on US dollar, there is no need to stick to the rules established by US. Russia does not need dollars or euros as ‚Äúpaper‚Äù or ‚Äúdigits‚Äù. Russia needs imported products, services and technologies that can be bought with those dollars or euros or other currencies. 

Of course, even with independent currency emission excessive foreign trade profits can be used for investment outside the country. However, in present circumstances any foreign investments don‚Äôt look wise. The West constantly and desperately pressures third-world countries to cease their cooperation with Russia and only the strongest ones have the guts to remain neutral. 

üîπRussian land has all necessary resources to sustain four times its current population. Rebuilding industry will take time, but it will be worth the effort. Russia will not perish, the only loss here will be the loss of extra profits for stakeholders of oil &gas companies. I wouldn‚Äôt be so sure about Russian customers in the West.

Of course, there are other aspects that are important in the issue of energy supplies. In rational world energy deal between two entities would mean that they would both seek to maintain as friendly relations as possible and avoid any actions against the other side. The customer fully dependent on supplies should not bite the supplier. However, actions of the collective Europe show that we no longer live in a rational world. Why bother then? 

Finally, the West is not the whole world. Exporting valuable natural resources in exchange for import of consumer goods and technologies sounds much more reasonable than selling them to enemies for money that have little real value.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2729.0,5.0,2022-10-20T15:52:19+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,80.0,MessageEntityBold,351.0,111.0,MessageEntityBold,822.0,96.0,MessageEntityBold,1381.0,184.0,MessageEntityBold,2671.0,70.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,362.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,362.0,,,,,MessageReplies,6.0,25478.0,False,[],,11043.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Message,10945,1639836943,,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"I think you didn't really read what I said. If you assess reality you find nuances.

 Russia is in the middle of an existential war. I don't agree with their hard power tactics. But it was absolutely necessary to get rid of the 5th column and Western NGOs aiming at regime change. These groups are quite literal enemies of Russia and the Russian State. So what would your solution be? Let them run loose destabilize your country and create civil war so a puppet regime can be put in place? And the pillage if Russian wealth can continue? Starving it's people? 

Yet honestly, if you think there is freedom of the press and freedom of speech here in the West you have been sleeping for the last three years at least, and definitely right through the war in Syria. During COVID anyone who asked questions about the proportionality of the measures with a platform was deplatformed, lost their jobs... Had their lives destroyed. Depending on which country you were in or how high your position was. Need I remind you of the people charged with treason for Facebook comments? Pregnant mother of three dragged from her home etc? The vigilanti beatings by empowered untrained local 'police'  in France,? The ban on the right to gather, organize, demonstrate?  The bank accounts of Canadian truckers  seized and frozen by the Canadian state?  There was near total censorship on any narrative outside the official one, as there is now. Where is the apology and reflection on mismanagemen, brutality  and the retractions on false information from State sources? Buried or non existent.

 We have aggressively attacked Russian culture, through sanctions we have stolen private property from civilians,  politicians all over Europe have been fired for questioning sanctions or Russophobia. Just for commentary. Fired for dancing with Putin years ago. Forced into exile. 

If we are so free where is the debate the discourse the democratic process? Where are the articles exposing Ukranian fakes? Zelenskys corruption, the open and deeply rooted fascism and neo Nazis in Ukrainian institutions and law? The Ukranian use of Petal mines against civilians? The atrocities against civilians in the Donbass? 

Why are European politicians promoting US interests above their own? Commiting economic suicide and destroying their countries? 

I think that the West does it differently, we use 'soft power'. So instead of having an open edict, in law ( but believe me the laws are changing quickly to enable greater repression and censorship)  -  Paypal seizes and freezes  funds for ' misinformation' anything that does not fit the official narrative. Facebook blocks accounts or strongly restricts traffic through algorithms. Is it freedom of speech if no one can see or hear you speaking? A recent Australian study shows that Twitter is overwhelmed by fake accounts and bots pushing the official narrative. So much so, that fake out numbers s real!  They deliberately troll and detail any discourse online.  People like Scott Ritter, of outstanding integrity and honor,  had their Twitter  accounts shut down for a single comment, that did not violate any law, except that it made Biden look bad. 

And again, the tangible interference and financial control of the legacy media by US/UK intelligence and national security. The deliberate, highly coordinated campaigns against critical academics. I mean ridiculously even classes in understanding propaganda, have been banned.

 Again people are losing their jobs for simply recording facts on the ground in Donbass like French journalist Anne Laure Bonnel. Who was fired from her job of 15 years at a French University for her journalism.

I follow people with direct expertise, (former) diplomats, military experts, analysts,  intelligence officers and independent journalists with years if not decades of experience in the region. I trust on the ground journalism ONLY from truly independent and reputable - ie proven integrity, journalists. I always have multiple sources, and a range of expertise that I can weigh 'facts' by. 

The point is, that these reliable sources if they are not echoing the fakes and war propaganda in favour of Ukraine are 'cancelled' in the West, and i increasingly smeared and  persecuted in mind  boogling ways. Like UK journalist Graham Philips and German journalist Alina Lipp. Who were charged without trail and had their bank accounts frozen.  Outstanding journalists of impeccable integrity  like Canadian Eva Bartlett have been placed on kill lists, and smeared. Even John Pilger has been cancelled.

The Western social and MSM media are thoroughly inflitrated and RUN by US/UK security and intelligence services. Twitter, the Guardian, the New York Times... Reuters and national media throughout Europe. Take time to research this.  Of course Facebook instagram etc
  Any truly independent media is aggressively deplatformed. Not just Russian media.

I also suggest actually viewing some Russian sources. In my experience there seems to be a lot of criticism and debate going on in Russia. For instance I am actually shocked at the quality, the standard is high. Especially if you compare that to the mindless rhetoric and one liners posing as political discourse in Western countries.

Like I watched a press conference with Putin last week, the questions were excellent and varied. Putin never fails to impress.

And this is coming from someone in the belly of the West and support anti oppression movements.  I should technically hate Russia and be most threatened by it. So while I certainly do not agree with  some policies in Russia, or think that it is far too heavy handed. I have also found that the idea that Russia is intolerant, and undemocratic, also to be inaccurate. People in the West simply do not understand the region, it's extraordinary cultural diversity, and it's history. There is not one size fits all in yes of good governance.

Due to my security I can't discuss my private info since it is illegal in the country I am currently in, to travel and fight in an armed conflict in a foreign country. I am liable to face more than 15 years in prison if caught. 

I'm a 28 year old former Marine, living alone somewhere in a country in Europe. Things haven't gone so well for me since I left the USMC. I've been arrested twice for conceal carrying a knife in public. I was recently released from the recent conviction where  I did 15 months in prison; during the span of which my home was burglarized twice. Nothing was done by the Police although there is a cam right next to my Apt door. Over $26,000 worth of things were stolen.

I saw the conflict in Ukraine for the first time on the prison TV and one day after another of observing the Russian crimes against civilians, I had to ask myself... live an empty life here, or fight to save those children whose little bodies are being torn to pieces by the Russian gov?
It's no longer a question I ask.

But after all I've been through, Im in a really bad situation and I just barely have enough for paying $200 rent and food, so my goal is to raise $6500 in order to pay for my travel and tactical kit I'll need in Ukraine.

‚Äî Russia will definitely learn its lessons from it and many lessons have already been learned. One of the most important lessons is about PR support. As it turned out, PR is essential element of swift success and broad support of any actions by international community. We really should have brought a vial of detergent to UN General Assembly as an excuse. 

In Russian-speaking world Russian actions are explained and covered adequately, but this is not the case in English-speaking world, especially when few English-language media from Russia have been banned and denied access to the most popular platforms in the Western world. We could hope that Western people would see the truth and real reasoning for the Russian operation, but they simply fell for everything that globalist media told them. 

Most people in the West are simply not interested in this story. They hear some noise about Russian attack on Ukraine and they don‚Äôt care about researching the background of the story. However, it means that they accept media narrative and don‚Äôt challenge the ‚Äúpublic opinion‚Äù.

üì¢ That said, Russian leadership could also learn a lesson from this unprecedented but not unexpected media attack and pay more attention to global PR aspect in future. They think that ‚Äúactions speak better than words‚Äù but forget that words may present those actions in very different light. Words are very important in modern world, as are those who control those words. 

Would ‚Äúfriends of Ukraine‚Äù be so determined to help Ukraine if this intervention was done by U.S. on the same excuses as Russia did? You know, end bloodshed, eliminate Nazi ideology, demilitarize belligerent state Doesn‚Äôt it sound a bit like the grounds for invasion of Iraq? Just put ‚ÄúBaasist‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúNazi‚Äù and that‚Äôs it. 

Would Europe be so determined to help Ukraine if global media focused on Ukrainian atrocities, murder of journalists, calls for genocide, prohibition of opposition parties, unprecedented corruption and other ‚Äúachievements of Ukrainian democracy‚Äù?

It‚Äôs all about information background and it looks like global media indeed have global influence. The question is, who defines the agenda for these media?

Will Russia learn the lesson? Covering actions with nice words is against Russian cultural traditions, but the world changes, so maybe. Hopefully, in future we will have a better world where Russia will not be forced to make such choices.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2680.0,6.0,2022-10-19T06:56:31+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,46.0,MessageEntityBold,142.0,55.0,MessageEntityBold,1036.0,92.0,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,1130.0,2.0,MessageEntityBold,1504.0,133.0,MessageEntityUnderline,2082.0,99.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,358.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,358.0,,,,,MessageReplies,18.0,25478.0,False,[],,14806.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

¬†
‚Äî Germany has been providing Ukraine with financial and military aid, often to detriment of its own reserves and at the same time it sees numerous humiliations and insults from Ukrainian ‚Äúdiplomats‚Äù against German government and even chancellor. 

Can‚Äôt use it without quotation marks, Ukrainian diplomacy is very specific with its main agenda being ‚ÄúGive us everything we ask or *** (censored)‚Äù.

Germany has been buying gas for itself and the entire Europe at exorbitant market prices sacrificing its money and its industry to make sure that European Union survives and doesn‚Äôt fall into deepest crisis in its history. All that to help Ukraine against Russia, while Russia is still offering its help to EU and Ukraine keeps asking for more and more and more. 

Germany closed eyes on its NATO ‚Äúallies‚Äù blowing up its own Nord Stream pipeline, which was the only backup way to supply Europe and prevent humanitarian disaster in case of any emergency with other gas sources.

Of course, this is not the entire Germany but mostly the loud ‚Äúgreen‚Äù coalition that tries to force chancellor Scholtz to lead the entire EU to collective suicide on the behalf of Ukraine. Germany does have forces of reason and we hear the voice of those forces, but they are not the ones making decision.   However, this all may change. Europe does have democratic institutions and if those forces of reason will manage to break the pressure of globalized media and present their case to electors, we still may see big shifts of power in Europe.   Global media keep hysterically shouting that Europeans must be ready for any sacrifices to defend their freedom. 

‚ùî But is Russia really threatening European freedom? And why must European people pay for stubborn stupidity of Ukrainian government?   Europeans should not forget that Ukrainian elites have been ignoring all attempts to solve the conflict diplomatically and were determined to kill or evict the entire population of their own region of Donbass, which didn‚Äôt agree with their agenda. They shouldn‚Äôt forget that their own OSCE mission recorded over 3,200 cases of ceasefire violations in Donbass just in 3 days a week before Russian intervention.   More and more Germans start to understand that they are facing sacrifices to help those very forces that they tried and managed to exterminate in their own country.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,3246.0,16.0,2022-10-18T16:51:57+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,64.0,MessageEntityBold,315.0,149.0,MessageEntityBold,688.0,141.0,MessageEntityUnderline,912.0,129.0,MessageEntityCustomEmoji,1707.0,1.0,MessageEntityBold,2155.0,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,356.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,356.0,,,,,MessageReplies,5.0,25478.0,False,[],,10748.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ukraine has been attacking the Donbass for 8 years because they wanted nothing to do with the US-sponsored coup and declared they would govern themselves, though still a part of Ukraine.  8 years of slaughter, 2 Minsk Agreements that Ukraine didn't honour later ... then a particularly horrific attack on a city at kids going home from school time, using illegal cluster bombs causing horrific carnage, and Putin said ""enough!!!""  I saw the video of the shattered bodies and the folk hosing the blood off the streets.  Appalling.
 He recognised the breakaway republics, declared them an ally, signed a mutual protection agreement, and proceeded to protect.  All legal ... because he is a lawyer at heart.
That was ""Russia invading"".
Now I personally think it was a trap to suck Russia in, then they, the hallowed West, could sanction Russia into poverty and the Russians would get rid of Putin.  That's what this is about.  Putin is the blocker to the NWO, the cabal who wants us to ""own nothing and you will be happy"" eating your bugs and afraid of their Climate Crisis scam.  Putin isn't having a bar of that ... plus Russia has more resources than anyone, even the US.
LOL, the sanctions backfired, as anyone who really knew anything about Russia would have known.  Now Europe, stalwarts of NATO, is in deep shit.  
So please, no Russia invaded Ukraine nonsense, it's unacceptable.
Ukraine is the most corrupt sewer in Europe.  It surpassed the Vatican Bank as the washing machine of dirty money, and  Biden and several other US Democrats are involved there.

‚Äî Ukraine does not have its own weapons that are capable of striking critical Russian infrastructure far beyond Russian-Ukrainian borders. It‚Äôs worth noting that Ukraine has been attacking civilian infrastructure in Belgorod region that borders Ukraine for a very long time. Other regions bordering Ukraine also have seen some strike attempts. Russian missile defense systems prevented a lot of them and showed great performance. 

Ukraine may have or get weapons capable of reaching critical Russian infrastructure deeper inside thecountry. Those weapons were or will be provided by the West and the West places restrictions on use of those weapons. So far, Russia refrained from causing critical and irreparable damage to Ukrainian infrastructure. Moreover, Russian President has warned NATO that any attack on Russia with weapons provided by NATO will result in imminent retaliation against NATO countries. 

Given this warning, it is highly unlikely that the West will allow Ukraine to attempt such strikes. 

‚ùóÔ∏èThey will be glad to fight Russia till the last Ukrainians but they aren‚Äôt eager to risk their own countries for a pointless attempt. 

‚ùîWhy is it pointless? Russian missile defense systems, especially those deployed in Moscow region, have over 99.99% chance to intercept a volley of up to 100 missiles launched within an hour. Ukrainian missile defense that consisted of old Soviet C-300 batteries managed to intercept a part of Russian missiles launched on Kiev during retribution strike. Russian batteries are several generations ahead and provide almost impenetrable protection. 

Missile defenses around Moscow were designed to defend the capital in time of nuclear war. For any chances to penetrate them, Europeans should give all their available missiles to Ukraine. Even if they are super lucky and hit a few facilities it won‚Äôt change anything. 

So the West can ‚Äúallow‚Äù Ukraine all they want. Russia explained the rules. If they try, there will be consequences. Even supplying such weapons to Ukraine would be risky for the West. They still think they can control Ukrainians but they have never tried telling them to stop.

UK has recently announced plans to supply Ukraine with medium-range missiles.

How can we accept this fatal blow to post-WW2 world order where all nations agreed not to move their borders by force, which would be the precedent for future land-grabs?¬ª

‚Äî Not really. Russia isn‚Äôt ‚Äúgrabbing land‚Äù sticks to the principles of self-determination. 

‚ùóÔ∏èIt wasn‚Äôt planned to organize recent referendums in the middle of fighting, but they were needed to assure local people that Russia will not abandon them. In fact, initial Russian terms didn‚Äôt include any ‚Äúland grabs‚Äù. 

Giving Russian land to Ukraine was ‚Äúfine‚Äù for everyone. Even Russia accepted it as long as Ukraine stayed friendly.

The whole thing started with Ukraine refusing to give autonomy to its regions as it agreed and using military force to bring them to toe. This is not a behavior that should be endorsed for a European country. Decisive European response to those actions would prevent all this. Even the lightest sanctions against Ukraine could prevent it all. Even official condemnation could prevent it all.

Now we have open military conflict but everyone presents the Russian side as aggressor. But it‚Äôs not so simple. Maybe Putin has just decided not to tolerate slow increase of sanction pressure, endless provocations and Donbass people dying every day and just cut the Gordian knot of East Ukraine once and for all.

Russia couldn‚Äôt abandon East Ukraine and it‚Äôs not about land grabs but about lives of people. Russian response probably also ruined lives, but the other side had a choice to prevent it, the most obvious and reasonable choice that coudl result in lasting peace and remove this ‚Äúhot spot‚Äù from the map ending the conflict forever. 

Yes, it would be a loss for Ukraine and the West. But it wouldn‚Äôt change the world order. The world is dynamic, new countries keep appearing on the map. Using force to prevent it is the same aggression, just seen from a different angle.

Rebel forces did try to negotiate. Germany, France and Russia helped to forge a win-win agreement between rebels and Ukraine that could end the conflict without dissolution of Ukrainian state. 

Ukraine accepted it but didn‚Äôt even start its implementation despite numerous promises to do so, with the most loud promises coming from present Ukrainian president who got into power solely because of those promises and desire of Ukrainians for peace.

The terms ‚ÄúNazis‚Äù and ‚ÄúNazism‚Äù are used excessively in the article to brand anything associated with the Ukrainian state, the Kyiv government, or the Ukrainian authorities.

The plan is to:

‚Äì destroy on the battlefield all the ‚ÄúNazis‚Äù who took up arms; meaning everybody

‚Äì liquidate part of the Ukrainians by carrying out mass repression of the entire Ukrainian population. ‚ÄúWar criminals‚Äù to be punished hard to set examples

‚Äì liquidate and ban all Ukrainian armed formations and all organisations associated with the practice of ‚ÄúNazism‚Äù

‚Äì give privileges to those waiting for the Russian authority (read: Donbas will rule)

‚Äì introduce Russian laws and Russian courts to ban language and culture

‚Äì introduce strict censorship, destroy textbooks and, in general, everything Ukrainian. Re-education of all segments of society where Ukrainian culture has taken hold

‚Äì ban even the name Ukraine and the term Ukrainian itself

‚Äì do all this by force and with the support of (military) power from Russia.

The plan is estimated to require some 30 years for full implementation (a generation of repression and annihilation). The West should accept this is a Russian matter: no interference.The failure lies in refusing to take seriously what comes from an unrestrained dictator-type ruler in a society where there are no more checks and balances, no mechanisms to brake or control any excesses. When the political, legal, economic system, courts, science and education and free media have all been subdued and brought under control. When the entire society has been fed hard-core propaganda for years. When intolerance, revanchism, ‚Äúbesieged fortress‚Äù mentality and militarism backs a cult of personality where extreme power is focused in one person. Hyper-nationalist elements have transformed into destructive imperialism. Such is today‚Äôs Russia. On all key parameters, society has deteriorated with a speed and trajectory similar to what has been observed before in Europe‚Äôs history. The path of such societies has always led to conflict.

Why Now?
The poor performance of the invading Russian forces in the first weeks, especially in the north of Ukraine and around Kyiv, has now led to partial Russian withdrawals. Poor morale among the Russian troops is obvious. While concentrating and regrouping the forces, there is a need for new motivation inducing the right spirit before the next large military push, likely concentrated along the eastern frontlines. The ‚ÄúNazis in Kyiv‚Äù trope is well-known so a clear and specific vision seems in demand in Russia.

There is also a dire need to present an explanation, a higher cause, for the significant Russian combat losses in Ukraine. By most accounts, the losses have already surpassed those sustained during the ten years, 1979-1989, of Soviet war in Afghanistan that in Soviet lingo was ‚Äúthe fulfilment of the international obligation to help the brotherly nation with a limited contingent of Soviet Forces in Afghanistan‚Äù.

With the article‚Äôs absolute and extreme demands, it tries to stimulate feelings that have been dear to dictators through the ages: blind loyalty to the state, a demand for an almost religious sacrifice of the individual for the cause of the leader, the enemy deprived of their humanity ‚Äì in fact,their his basic right of existence.

No surprise President Zelenskyy reacted harshly to the article during his speech to the Romanian Parliament(opens in a new tab), saying, inter alia, that the article promotes genocide and ‚Äúdescribes a clear and calculated procedure for the destruction of everything that makes Ukrainians Ukrainian and our people themselves‚Äù.

Recently FSB has arrested a Ukrainian saboteur in Moscow region. He possessed two ‚ÄúIgla‚Äù MANPADs and it is likely that he was planning a terrorist attack on civilian airplane or aircraft used for training young pilots.

Ukrainians and their Western sponsors would surely cheer him and call him a great hero if he succeeded with his plans. Anyway, how is this relevant to the question?

The thing is, weapons supplied to Ukraine are not tightly controlled with possible exception of some high-grade items such as HIMARS. Nobody is checking how many Javelins are there and whether they are lost in combat, exploded or simply sold away.

For many months it is possible to buy virtually any weapons supplied to Ukraine en masse on the black market and according to reports it‚Äôs still possible today. Darknet offers a plenty of opportunities and Ukrainians have been known for their successes on black market of weapons ever since collapse of USSR. Prices are quite low and diversity of offers is impressive.

According to anonymous reports of Ukrainian servicemen, illegal weapon trade is flourishing on all levels, from sergeants to generals. It‚Äôs not just Western-supplied weapons, it‚Äôs everything. It is really very easy to write-off weapons as used, lost or destroyed in battle or combat operation, nobody is able to check this.

üî∫The West has supplied Ukraine with weapons worth close to 100 billion USD. Considering the level of corruption in Ukraine, it is quite easy to imagine that at least some Ukrainians couldn‚Äôt resist the temptation to gain some material benefit from the conflict.

‚ÅâÔ∏èWhere do these weapons go? Some are purchased by European and international criminal gangs as it‚Äôs a rare opportunity to expand their arsenals. Some are purchased‚Ä¶ by Russians. This applies only to latest equipment. Russian intelligence services still claim that they managed to purchase HIMARS for about $900k a couple months ago.

However, most of the weapons go to ‚Äúhot spots‚Äù all around the world. Weapons from Ukraine were seen in Kosovo and Bosnia, in the Middle East, in Africa.

Interestingly, there was even a case with one NLAW unit being sold in Alaska.

Are there any risks to countries that supply those weapons? Not for the United States. As for Europeans, they don‚Äôt see those risks as well as potential future risks. They don‚Äôt understand that a large part of these weapons will end in Europe. If not now, then when the conflict is over or when Ukrainian army will feel imminent defeat. Moreover, when the conflict is over, criminal underworld of Europe may see serious changes with hundreds thousands of Ukrainians with military experience and weapons willing to ‚Äúreunite with their families‚Äù.

Even if Ukraine wins by some miracle, there will be people who would prefer ‚Äúeasy money‚Äù and ‚Äúbeautiful life‚Äù in Europe to hard mundane work at home. Such things often happen after wars. Many Vietnam and Iraq veterans in U.S., many Afghanistan and Chechnya veterans in Russia couldn‚Äôt find themselves a place in civilian life. With seemingly rich, prosperous and weak Europe just around the corner it won‚Äôt be hard for Ukrainian veterans to win a place in European underworld.

And crime is not the only risk. How about terrorism? 

‚ÅâÔ∏èWhat if next time a terrorist with MANPAD will appear not near Moscow but somewhere around Berlin, Paris or London?

Business tycoons also get their share for their private armies, but that is the last thing Europe should worry about, these weapons will be used to divide power after the conflict is over.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2795.0,5.0,2022-10-13T17:54:35+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,141.0,MessageEntityBold,527.0,133.0,MessageEntityUnderline,937.0,148.0,MessageEntityBold,1473.0,75.0,MessageEntityBold,1737.0,27.0,MessageEntityUnderline,2139.0,83.0,MessageEntityBold,2363.0,107.0,MessageEntityBold,3384.0,115.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,345.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,345.0,,,,,MessageReplies,2.0,25478.0,False,[],,10247.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Message,10130,1639836943,2022-10-12T13:13:06+00:00,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"¬´Why do Russians keep accusing so many countries of Russophobia? Don't they understand that these countries have a good reason to be afraid of them and distrust their intentions?¬ª

‚Äî No, Russians don‚Äôt understand it. If Russia will declare a new ideology and will promise to spread it all over the world, there will be a reason to be afraid. If Russia officially proclaims that it wishes to return all its former lands, there will be a reason to be afraid. This is not the case.
¬†
In post-Soviet period Russia has shown that its friends have absolutely nothing to fear. NATO is not the only way to defend from Russia, being on friendly terms works as well.
¬†
Russians accuse so many countries of Russophobia because Russian media publishes quotes of the most russophobic media articles and statements of politicians. Not so many Russians travel abroad and they naturally think that if some prominent Polish politician is russophobic, every Pole is a russophobe. 

This has created a lot of distrust between Russia and its former allies, especially since virtually all of those allies suddenly became members of EU (economical competitor) and NATO (hostile military bloc).
¬†
The other issue is that russophobia became a national idea in many post-Soviet countries. New elites wanted to strengthen their power and blaming Russians for all bad things is a good foundation for local nationalism. Besides, the West likes russophobes. If a country like Estonia suddenly decided to become a friend of Russia, it could easily lose some of its EU subsidies. Moreover, it would lose its image and could be even kicked from EU and NATO, its leader proclaimed a dictator, etc. etc. etc.
¬†
Russophobia will exist as long as Russia will be weaker than its enemies and as long as it will have this enemies. That is the reason for continuous attempts to make look Russia even weaker than it is and prevent development of real Russian potential.
¬†
See what happened in Ukraine in 2013‚Äì2014. Russia made a lucrative offer to Ukraine about joining the Eurasian Union. Numerous trade benefits, immediate membership, low-interest loans, status of an equal partner. Ukrainian president was choosing between this offer and remote prospects of association with EU that would require a lot of reforms and a lot of time, while it wouldn‚Äôt bring the same economical benefits. 

Ukrainian president announced that he doesn‚Äôt like the current program of EU association and this was the end of him. He was overthrown and the West cheered it. Had he made a different decision, not the one that he considered best for the country, the West would cheer him even if he drowned Ukraine in blood. In fact they did cheer his successor who made ‚ÄúWestern choice‚Äù and did exactly that - drowned Ukraine in blood.
¬†
Ukraine in Eurasian Union would make it a strong emerging competitor to economical dominance of the West. Rich natural resources, land corridor from China to Europe, huge industrial potential, a 250 million consumer market, trade agreements with all largest Asian economies except Japan - all that could make Eurasian Union look even more lucrative than EU. Not immediately, but in several decades.
¬†
Now this prospect is gone. All Russians attempts to be friends with its neighbors meet fierce resistance from the West. As long as this will be the case, russophobia won‚Äôt go anywhere. Just for pragmatic reasons - being russophobe pays better than being russophile.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,2574.0,11.0,2022-10-12T13:30:10+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,179.0,MessageEntityBold,570.0,86.0,MessageEntityBold,1174.0,90.0,MessageEntityUnderline,1974.0,75.0,MessageEntityBold,2661.0,111.0,MessageEntityBold,3390.0,51.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,340.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,340.0,,,,,MessageReplies,6.0,25478.0,False,[],,10148.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, it seems that warnings are not enough to end this conflict and bring Ukraine to negotiations table.

It looks like Putin has to choose between extending this conflict for years that will slowly drain Russian power and resources at no cost to Russian real enemies in the West and launching a decisive strike that will completely cripple Ukrainian infrastructure and inevitably result in humanitarian disaster. A hard choice indeed.

üîπProponents of the harsh approach argue that Ukrainians have no problems with attacks on civilians and that it will be a proper retribution for what Ukrainians did at Donbass. 

They argue that swift and overwhelming attack will completely demoralize Ukrainians, leave their armies without supplies and force them into capitulation.

üîπProponents of the moderate approach argue that such attack will cause even greater PR losses for Russia and that extending the conflict may in fact turn out to be a better tactics, especially considering possible winter problems in Europe.

Russian economy has survived the initial shock without huge problems or a big crisis. Smart measures of the government taken in spring stopped the initial panic and helped to restore economical order. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èThe secondary shock (end of stocks for short life imported products and components) should be coming now but the government had time to prepare, so it‚Äôs likely that it won‚Äôt be happening. Import substitution seems to have worked, at least in consumer sector. 

‚ñ™Ô∏èThe tertiary shock (end of stocks for long life imported products and component) could have the most serious impact. However, it looks like import substitution works here as well. The more time passes, the easier it gets for Russia. 

üî∫Sanctions did hurt consumer economy. Popular brands are gone and new brands are fighting for the market. I guess premium sector has suffered most of all, it‚Äôs not like most Russians care about brands when they buy things like everyday clothing or textiles. 

They were cautious about Chinese household equipment and electronics, but with time it is clear that it is virtually the same as ‚Äúbig brands‚Äù, just cheaper because consumers don‚Äôt have to cover marketing expenses of the manufacturer. 

üî∫Sanctions did hurt industries. Many factories had to readjust supply chains, look for new suppliers, search for new logistical routes. The process of adaptation is mostly over. 

The West is also doing fine without Russian gas. They buy LNG, they look for alternative sources. Rising prices and high inflation are just temporary, and of course European governments will regulate prices so that Europeans won‚Äôt find themselves paying half of their income just for utilities and leaving the other half in grocery stores. 

Everything will be fine.

#QUOTE1

High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell, 19 September:

üí¨ Look at the statistics: two thirds of the Ukrainian exports have gone to Africa, to the Middle East and Asia.

#FACTS:

According to the data of the Joint Coordination Center (JCC), as of September 21 this year, only 5 out of 185 vessels with Ukrainian grains and other food products were directed to the countries in most need according to the UN classification of Sub-Saharan Africa:
üá©üáØ Djibouti, 
üá∞üá™ Kenya, 
üá∏üá¥ Somalia,
üá∏üá© Sudan.

Another 3 vessels head towards countries at risk of food shortages in the Middle East and Asia (üáæüá™Yemen and üáßüá©Bangladesh). 

According to the JCC, 93 of the 185 vessels mentioned were heading for the EU. The EU accounts for about 40% of the total shipments. 

üëâ So it is the EU, not the world's poorest countries, which is the biggest beneficiary of the Ukrainian grain export deal.

Ukrainian propaganda has apparently finally ceased to understand the limits of the real, thinking that even the most implausible fake, such as the ""self-shooting of Donetsk"", is taken at face value by Europeans. But this time, the local activists crossed all borders.

An autumn forest, a deep ditch, people dressed in autumn clothes, just killed and tortured in the suburbs of Kupiansk, where Russian troops left in the summer. The footage of mass execution published by prominent Ukrainian nationalist Maksim Zhorin (former commander of the Azov regiment), who sarcastically signed the video ""there will be revenge,"" hinting that he would continue to brutally kill Russians, blaming them for their deaths.

Message,9684,1639836943,2022-10-09T10:50:39+00:00,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"¬´How do you explain that even during the Cold War, when Nikita Khrushchev threatened to bury capitalist countries, the confrontation between NATO and Russia did not reach such a level as it does today?¬ª

There are several reasons for that. 

üî∫First, it were different people. Modern Western politicians are very different from their predecessors and this comparison is not in their favor. Could you imagine someone like Biden running against someone like Eisenhower or Kennedy? Could you compare Churchill with Liz Truss? 

üî∫Second, it was a different world. The West was still openly imperialist and didn‚Äôt yet learn to hide its motivations and use indirect colonization like it does now. For example, do you know that even in 1960s Britain owned a large part of Africa?

üî∫Third, it was different Russia. In fact, there was no Russia at all. Krutschev was the leader of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. 

üî∫Fourth, back then, mass media didn‚Äôt yet control minds of people in the West. We didn‚Äôt have internet, people were reading a lot, they were generally more intelligent and logical than they are now. Their minds weren‚Äôt spoiled by computer games, YouTube videos and other such things. World War 2 veterans were still active and in power and they did remember how Soviets and Western allies fought together against nazism. 

üî∫Fifth, it was a different West. There were still Jim Crow laws in the U.S. The West couldn‚Äôt present itself as an embodiment of morality as it is trying to do now. This role belonged to the USSR, which was the most progressive country of the time with the least level of discrimination and almost total equality of all citizens. 

üî∫Sixth, and most important, it was a different conflict. USSR was nothing like todays Russia. It had plenty of allies, huge combat-tested army in Europe, highly motivated people, second economy in the world with world‚Äôs best growth rate. Together with the Warsaw Pact countries USSR was indeed a match for the United States. 

As for now‚Ä¶ Russia has been pressured by NATO for decades, it was provoked to attack its own brotherly nation and was assigned a label of global villain. The West is fighting a shadow of USSR that no longer exists. USSR has voluntarily disbanded its military bloc and soon after that it collapsed into a group of countries. Borders of some of those countries had little to do with their history or the will of people living there. The process was not negotiated, interests of the people were not taken into account. 

This resulted in many civil conflicts on post-Soviet space, with Russian Federation acting as peacekeeper in all of those conflicts. Western leaders distort everything that is said about Russian actions and try to create false Russian image in eyes of their people and rest of the world. This is common between present days and Cold War times, however, in times of Cold War their people were not as easily manipulated.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,3380.0,16.0,2022-10-09T10:52:56+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,204.0,MessageEntityItalic,204.0,38.0,MessageEntityBold,2002.0,213.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,322.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,322.0,,,,,MessageReplies,35.0,25478.0,False,[],,9973.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

‚Äî Well, it looks quite reasonable to withdraw committment into a conflict world away, focus on internal development and profit on trade with the parties involved in this conflict. 

I think it‚Äôs more about choosing an enemy for the US. The US needs a global enemy to justify its defense industry, huge army and presence all around the globe. And I think that those Republicans think that Russia is not such an enemy. 

Russia is fighting ‚Äúeconomical war‚Äù with the West right now, a war that has been forced on it. While termination of Russian trade had a serious impact on Europe, the United States didn‚Äôt suffer from it. The United States get additional bonuses from economical weakness of Europe, as it becomes a large market for US products and services while European capitals flee to the safety of US federal bonds and securities.

Russia is not fighting any energy war to win it or lose it. Russia is a large global supplier of energy and fuel.

High oil prices are beneficial for Russia and Saudi Arabia, two biggest oil producers. At the present state of global economy oil prices are not that relevant for Russia because Russia has little means to use extra oil profits without proper economical reforms and expansion of foreign trade. In fact, with reduced import volumes and unacceptable risks of foreign investments Russian state has little incentives to increase export.

‚Äî Of course, those are obvious benefits for the US, although it looks like American people don‚Äôt see any fruits of this transfer of wealth and increased markets for US products (including natural gas). Looks like most of the profits just end in pockets of those who are already rich. 

We don‚Äôt know what did the U.S.A. do to provoke Russian invasion of Ukraine. Yes, they were among those who started this conflict back in 2014 by supporting street rebels against legitimate government. Yes, they kept supporting Ukrainian government and turning eyes away from all their controversial actions even without any public or private reprimands. 

We can only guess what was the final straw that made Putin give the order. Atrocities in Donbass have continued for 8 years and he had all time in the world to intervene earlier. So while this was the official reason and it was a good and valid reason, the actual reason for choosing this specific time and method of intervention must indeed like somewhere else. Maybe it was ignorance towards Russian demands of NATO containment. 

Maybe it was about Zelensky‚Äôs speech in Munich where he mentioned a possibility of getting nuclear weapons for Ukraine. Maybe it was some covert secret related to U.S. biological weapon labs in Ukraine, which are still not explained. 

We can‚Äôt be sure that the U.S. did provoke the special operation of Russian Armed Forces in Ukraine, but we can be sure that the U.S. did all they could to extend the conflict and inflict maximum damage to Russia without actually becoming a side of the conflict. We can be sure that Ukraine has NATO weapons and NATO military advisors and well, they wouldn‚Äôt be there without approval of US. 

U.S. views about ending this conflict are quite intriguing. Even if their media screams otherwise, the decision makers surely know that there are no chances for Russian defeat without direct NATO intervention and such intervention would result in new World War. 

They know that they need to weaken Europe as potential competitor, but they don‚Äôt need to to destroy it because it must stay as market for their products and resources. There must be some point when they will say ‚Äúenough‚Äù to their puppets. 

The question is, when will this point come. American people are already questioning continued weapon supplies to Ukraine and excessful attention to the issue in times of numerous domestic problems. In fact, most Americans wouldn‚Äôt be able to show Ukraine on the map and this conflict doesn‚Äôt touch them personally despite all media attempts to incite their emotions. 

They are as indifferent about Ukraine as they were about Iraq, Afghanistan and millions other conflicts with U.S. involvement. As long as it doesn‚Äôt touch them personally, they don‚Äôt care. 

They care more about increasing gas prices than about anything that is happening in the Eastern Hemisphere. Most Americans don‚Äôt bother to look deeper into roots and specifics this conflict simply because they are not interested. 

They just repeat what they see on mainstream channels and it‚Äôs not because they are all stupid but because they are not interested. The Ukrainian conflict is as irrelevant for American masses as some conflict in Myanmar would be irrelevant for Russian masses.

If we are speaking about situation at the moment, then no. 
Not now. 

There could still be a large number of ‚Äúsausage voters‚Äù, i. e. people ready to abandon national ideas and cultural heritage for better life. However, most such people have already fled Russia. 

And they never were a majority. Significant minority - yes. But not majority. It would depend on circumstances and conditions, of course. For example, if EU completely changed, abandoned its most controversial liberal ideas returning to its pre-2005 ideology and joined Russia in its military operation, Russian would surely choose becoming a part of such EU. 

Not in last 10‚Äì15 years. Average Russians don‚Äôt like EU not only because they are geopolitical enemies and actual enemies at the moment. They don‚Äôt like European ultraliberal ideology, which is trying to enforce the idea that rights of minorities are superior to rights of majority. 

Sure, it would depend on specific circumstances and there would be a loud and numerous minority supporting this initiative, but the majority still wouldn‚Äôt accept it.
It would be possible something like before 2010. In 1990s all Russians would vote for it unanimously. 

However, you have to understand that it has little to do with so called ‚ÄúEuropean values‚Äù and ‚ÄúEuropean freedoms‚Äù, it‚Äôs simply about quality of life. I have my doubts about quality of life in Europe, especially for middle class, but for average Russians of 1990s and even early 2000s it would be like a dream. 

Even today a lot of Russians believe in myths about ‚Äú5000 euro pensions‚Äù and ‚Äúpensioners spending time traveling the world on luxury cruise liners‚Äù. Well, it‚Äôs not a myth, sure, but it‚Äôs not like those pensioners are getting money from state like Russian ones.

Message,9113,1639836943,2022-10-03T08:25:09+00:00,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"Why are we sanctioning Russia when we depend on them for energy supply?

Sanctions against Russia were an attempt to cripple Russian military-industrial complex and create a hard time for Russian Armed Forces in Ukraine.

Both those objectives were not fulfilled. Russia has been weapon exporter for a long time and its military industrial complex was not dependent on import (and on external cash flow). 

Yes, some minor components were imported but nothing that couldn‚Äôt be replaced from local sources. Self-sufficient military industrial complex is an important aspect of a sovereign great power and Russia does have this aspect.

Russian Armed Forces in Ukraine don‚Äôt see any problem from sanctions. Soldiers are paid in rubles, their supplies come from local Russian sources. They have much more problems because of Western aid to Ukraine in form of military aid, mercenaries and NATO military advisors.

Sanctions against Russia resulted in some problems for Russian people. Fortunately, Russian government headed by Prime Minister Mishustin acted very smart and their brilliant and well-timed actions helped prevent economical crisis. Everything is fine in Russia. 

One last wave of the crisis (end of stock reserves of imported products and components that were available in Russia by February 2022) may hit Russia in a couple months, but the government had months to prepare for it, so I don‚Äôt think it will have any consequences.

Anyway, this sanction war has shown that both the West and Russia can survive without each other. However, people of both camps have problems because of trade termination. Not critical problems, but noticeable.

For Russia it‚Äôs more about absence of familiar brands, not about real shortage of something. No deficit of anything on consumer market.

For the West it‚Äôs increased energy costs that result in increased costs of anything. 

This is a long-term issue and now after North Stream explosions there is no easy way to bring energy costs down, even if Russia agrees to resume full supply. 

Ukrainian gas transit system is in a state of complete dilapidation and has been so for decades. Bringing it to modern safety standards would require investments comparable to costs of North Stream pipelines. 

And well, there will always be some political issue. By the way, despite Russian-Ukrainian military conflict those pipelines are still working. East European hawks say that they can meet all demands of Europe if needed.. in fact it‚Äôs a bit more complicated.

There is no simple solution to energy crisis in the West. The world will critically depend on fossil fuels for at least fifty more years. Nuclear option is available but electrical power can‚Äôt be used everywhere. 

Besides, Russia owns or controls a large part of global uranium reserves. By the way, North Stream pipeline was constructed with consideration of future green economy, it was adapted to transport hydrogen in addition to natural gas.

Well, that‚Äôs about it. Why are you sanctioning Russia? If you ask this question, it means that you are not sanctioning Russia. Your government is. Most likely they are doing so in solidarity with other Western governments. 

The United State of America has its own economical interests in sanctioning Russia. They did not depend on import from Russia and they don‚Äôt have much to lose. However, they get huge benefits and huge profit potential by replacing Russia as supplier of energy resources to Europe.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,3139.0,13.0,2022-10-03T08:28:58+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,71.0,MessageEntityBold,506.0,127.0,MessageEntityItalic,705.0,77.0,MessageEntityBold,1443.0,98.0,MessageEntityUnderline,1879.0,158.0,MessageEntityBold,2567.0,80.0,MessageEntityBold,2958.0,127.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,295.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,295.0,,,,,MessageReplies,2.0,25478.0,False,[],,9961.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2. If Russia Nation survival is threatened, imminent response.

Could mobilization provoke widespread anger at Putin while offering little short-term help on the battlefield? There is no simple way to train, equip and find officers for a vast new army. The process would probably take more than a year?

- Highly unlikely. Firstly, during all the opinion polls conducted in Russia including those of made by western or western backed sociologists, the result has been that Russian overwhelmingly support both Putin and the war effort. Statista reports that in August 2022, so about a month ago, 80% of Russians supported the war. 

Recent events might have changed this slightly, but a military defeat in the field doesn‚Äôt make people abandon the war effort, it usually makes them more angry and determined to fight on. England didn‚Äôt give up in WW2, because they lost France, on the contrary it made them get serious.

As for offering little help, increasing the formations of the army to full strength is not going to do nothing. Again, do you really think Russia would spent billions on a joke? Massive logistical and economic strain is not something you do because it has no impact.

In my estimation, the full impact of the mobilization will not be felt for some time, possibly several months, for various reasons. But have no doubt, it will have some impact. Will it mean a drastic reversal for Ukraine? Maybe not, but once it is fully deployed, it is quite likely you‚Äôll notice.

As for your premise there is no simple way to train equip and find officers for a vast army, you are wrong. That is the point of reservists. When an officer leaves the army, they become part of the officer reserve. And Russia had an excess of officers in the past. They don‚Äôt need to train officers, these guys are already trained. 

Maybe they will need a refresher course, however that will not take long. As for equipment, the Russian arsenals were made for supplying an army of up to 4 million in war time. Supplying 300,000 will probably not be a problem. You are somehow thinking that reservists are new recruits.

EU Countries Plan to Delay Russian Oil Price Cap Amid Divisions. The 27 member states need to unanimously agree on sanctions. Countries also discussing export restrictions on electronics. 

European Union nations are struggling to reach an accord on imposing a price cap on Russian oil and will likely push back a deal on the issue until after a broader sanctions package has been agreed. 

Cyprus and Hungary are among the countries that have expressed opposition to the oil cap proposal, according to people familiar with the ongoing talks. Sanctions in the EU require unanimity, giving each nation an effective veto.

The European Commission, the bloc‚Äôs executive arm, met with member states over the weekend to try to find a compromise on the package of restrictive measures, according to the people.

It‚Äôs not about believing. And it‚Äôs not about Russians but about their leaders. Words are just words. Empty words.

Geopolitics looks at potentials.

The examples of people like Saddam and the last Lybian leader shows that the West cannot be trusted. The West is not monolithic, but their groups of power support each other when the decision is made. Sure, not everyone in US elites was fond about invasion of Iraq, all decision-makers perfectly knew that chemical weapons are a fake, some may have opposed it, but when the decision was made, the entire Western block joyously approved this.

The Western block has clear goal - to preserve their economical and military superiority and to keep status quo by thriving over the rest of the world. Leader of the Western block, the United States of America has additional goal to prevent other countries and entities in this block from getting too powerful and challenging their status as ultimate decision maker.

The Western block has clear enemies - all countries that can challenge their superiority in any aspects. This is especially true about economical superiority.

Russian attempt to create a Eurasian Union could create such a challenger. With Ukraine this Union would be a viable entity with over 250 million consumers. In a few decades it could emerge as a competing economical power. In addition to military potential of Russia, this would create unacceptable challenge. That is the ultimate reason for Western interference in Ukraine in 2014 and one of the roots of current events.

The West doesn‚Äôt want to destroy Russia. It wants Russia weak and controllable. It wants Russia as a ‚Äúglobal gas station‚Äù with most profits ultimately going to Wall Street pockets.

Russia is not the only entity weakened by this crisis. It also hurts Europe. Cooperation between Russia and Europe, especially between Russia and Germany could change the situation with the entire Europe virtually being economical and political vassal of the United States.",0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,3348.0,14.0,2022-09-27T16:12:46+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,68.0,MessageEntityBold,183.0,34.0,MessageEntityBold,1611.0,182.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,False,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,275.0,"{'_': 'PeerChannel', 'channel_id': 1585032928}",,275.0,,,,,MessageReplies,9.0,25478.0,False,[],,9285.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1585032928.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

‚ÄúGraphenartige‚Äù Objekte f√ºhren zu Gerinnungsst√∂rungen

In Italien belegt eine Studie, dass 94 Prozent der Menschen nach einer mRNA-Injektion ein ungew√∂hnliches Blutbild aufweisen. Demnach finden sich dort mysteri√∂se Fremdk√∂rper, welche vor den Injektionen nicht vorhanden gewesen waren.

Zu diesem Schluss kommen die Studienforscher, die  √Ñrzte Franco Giovannini, Riccardo Benzi Cipelli und Gianpaolo Pisano. Die Ergebnisse der Studie wurde im August 2022 im ‚ÄúInternational Journal of Vaccine Theory, Practice and Research‚Äù (IJVTPR) ver√∂ffentlicht. 

In der TV-Sendung ‚ÄúPiazza Libert√†‚Äù erkl√§rt der Dr. Gianpaolo Pisano, dass die ‚Äúgraphenartigen‚Äù Objekte einen magnetischen Effekt erzeugen, der sich ung√ºnstig auf die Gerinnung der roten Blutk√∂rperchen auswirke. Die Folge seien Herzinfarkte sowie Zirkulationsst√∂rungen.

Watch volunteers to take an elderly couple out of Mariupol. They are the Kisel family, both are over 70. Their house was partially destroyed by Ukrainian nationalists and left with no water and no heat. All the neighbours hid in the basement. Maria and Aleksander Kisel remained in their apartment. 

Aleksander Vasilyevich is disabled and has a wheelchair. For several days he lay on the cold floor in the hall; his wife couldn‚Äôt lift him. The story of saving Kisel family is in our video.

Am 20. August 2022 starb die 29 j√§hrige Daria Dugina bei einem Mordanschlag. Sie war nicht nur eine Unterst√ºtzerin der Ideen ihres Vaters, sondern auch selbst eine lebhafte Denkerin, Publizistin und Journalistin.

Daria wurde f√ºr die Idee einer gerechten multipolaren Welt ohne westliche Hegemonie get√∂tet. Die Eliten der USA und Gro√übritanniens verstehen, dass es Ideen sind, die die Welt regieren... Deshalb haben sie beschlossen, ihre Quellen zu vernichten.
Doch sie haben eine Sache nicht berechnet ‚Äì eine Idee kann nicht zerst√∂rt werden.

Der Tod des M√§dchens geschah vor den Augen seines Vaters. Dieser sagte nach dem Tod seiner Tochter:
""...Wir brauchen nur unseren Sieg. Meine Tochter hat ihr M√§dchenleben auf den Altar gelegt... doch auch jetzt inspiriert sie die S√∂hne unseres Vaterlandes zu Heldentaten!""

""Ukraine continues to fire internationally-banned anti-personnel mines on civilian areas of Donetsk and other cities in the Donetsk People‚Äôs Republic (DPR), in violation of international law and of the mine ban convention Ukraine signed in 1999 and ratified in 2005.

Since July 27, Ukraine has been firing rockets containing cluster munitions filled with banned PFM-1 ‚ÄúPetal‚Äù (or ‚ÄúButterfly‚Äù) anti-personnel mines all over Donetsk and surrounding areas. Each rocket contains over 300 of the mines. Already by August 3, the DPR‚Äôs Ministry of Emergency Situations noted that Ukraine had fired several thousand of the prohibited mines on Donetsk.

As of August 15, 44 civilians, including two children, have suffered gruesome injuries. Another mine victim died in hospital.

Some days ago, such mines grotesquely maimed a 15 year old boy in Donetsk.

Younger children don‚Äôt know that the mines aren‚Äôt toys, and elderly often simply don‚Äôt see them, or likewise don‚Äôt understand the danger, as was the case with an elderly lady with dementia who, on August 8, lost a foot as a result of stepping on a mine while she was going to work in her garden plot.

Tiny but powerful, these insidious mines are designed not to kill but to tear off feet or hands. Their design allows them to float to the ground without exploding, where they easily blend in with most settings and generally lie dormant until stepped on or otherwise disturbed.

According to Konstantin Zhukov, Chief Medical Officer of Donetsk Ambulance Service, a weight of just 2 kg is enough to activate one of the mines. Sometimes, however, they explode spontaneously. An unspoken tragedy on top of the already tragic targeting of civilians is that dogs, cats, birds and other animals are also victims of these dirty mines.

In the grass, or surprisingly even on sidewalks and streets, it is very easy to overlook them or mistake them for a leaf. Even when I‚Äôve seen such mines marked with warning signs or circled, it still took me quite a bit to actually see them.

In its relentless deploying of these mines, Ukraine has targeted all over Donetsk, as well as Makeevka to the east and Yasinovataya to the north. Ukraine has fired them elsewhere, including the hard-hit northern DPR city of Gorlovka, as well as regions in the Lugansk People‚Äôs Republic in previous months.

In fact, according to DPR authorities, Ukraine began using the mines in March, during battles for Mariupol, and in May was already firing them into DPR settlements. Also in early May, while in Rubiznhe in the Lugansk People‚Äôs Republic, I was warned that Ukraine had been littering nearby areas with the mines, something confirmed by locals when I went to nearby Sievierodonetsk on August 12....""

Mariupol hat noch einen langen Weg bis zum Wiederaufbau vor sich, aber eines der dringendsten Projekte ist die Entminung der Stadt, insbesondere ihrer strategisch wichtigen Standorte. So wird beispielsweise der Flughafen von Mariupol derzeit aktiv entmint, und der Prozess wird noch lange dauern, denn die Ukrainer haben sich wirklich viel M√ºhe gegeben.  
 
üëâ Angesichts der Professionalit√§t der Minenr√§umer und der Verf√ºgbarkeit moderner Entminungsausr√ºstung scheint die Aufgabe zwar gef√§hrlich, aber nicht unm√∂glich zu sein. ‚ùóÔ∏è
 
üí¨ ‚ÄúDie neuesten Bombenentsch√§rfungsroboter der Marke ‚ÄúUran-6‚Äù arbeiten neben der Startbahn. Sie sind mit speziellen Schleppnetzen ausgestattet, die Antipersonenminen des Drucktyps schnell aufsp√ºren und entsch√§rfen k√∂nnen‚Äù, berichtet der Reporter des TV-Senders ‚ÄúZvezda‚Äù.

Mr. Zelensky will easily put both his own citizens and Europeans in radiactive danger for vast media coverage. Therefore, a catastrophic provocation at the Zaporozhye NPP cannot be ruled out.

Lt. Col. Daniel Davis agrees. In his opinion, them in Kyiv are well aware that Ukrainian army does not advance on the battlefield and no military success is expected. Thus, we cannot ruled out that Zelensky will order to conduct a massive strike on the nuclear power plant to have gigantic media coverage with Ukraine presented as a victim of Russian mindless attacks.

The digital influencer, actor and event promoter, Nilton Moreira, died this Monday (15), a victim of complications from Covid-19.

Very active on social networks and with more than 34 thousand followers, Nilton had not been publishing in the last five weeks ‚Äì when he inserted a post with a June look.

At the end of this morning, some friends and followers came to question, still in disbelief, what could have happened to the boy.

¬†
üîµ On 5-6 August the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) once again attacked ZNPP by shelling the critically important infrastructural objects of the plant as well as its satellite city Energodar. Twenty shells have been fired during the strikes

üîµ On 5 August, at 14:45, the Ukrainian shelling (three shells hit in the proximity of the training centre next to the territory of the open switchgear of the NPP) resulted in shutdown of the autotransformer and the high voltage line providing backup power to the Units ‚Ññ1 and ‚Ññ2 of ZNPP

üîµ On 5 August, at 16:45, the Ukrainian side committed an artillery shelling (four shells) of oil and fuel oil handling equipment and the site of hydrogen receivers. Damage of the pipeline caused jet fire that was localized due to timely and professional actions of ZNPP personnel and Russian military

üîµ On 6 August, at 19:42, the AFU units attacked ZNPP once again. Three artillery shells of 155 millimeters caliber (NATO standard) exploded next to the spent fuel storage and only 200 meters from the operating unit. One person was injured

üîµ On 7 August ZNPP was again shelled by the Ukrainian armed formations. The high-voltage power line ‚ÄúKakhovskaya‚Äù was damaged. Equipment of an open switchgear (750 kW) was damaged as a result of a power surge. At Unit ‚Ññ4, that was operational at 10% capacity, the power supply of control and safety system went offline. This triggered the emergency protection of the Unit ‚Ññ4

üîµ The Ukrainian personnel of the plant has decided on cooldown of the Unit¬†‚Ññ4 of ZNPP, as well as downpower of the Units ‚Ññ5 and ‚Ññ6. Currently, the Units ‚Ññ5 and ‚Ññ6 are downpowered to 500 MW

üîµ On 11 August Ukrainian armed formations again tried to attack the ZNPP with missiles and UAVs. This attack was repulsed by the air defense forces

üîµ In addition to direct military threats to the security of ZNPP the Kiev regime is working on other scenarios to create intentional preconditions for a nuclear accident at ZNPP. Inter alia, Kiev is considering different options of cutting the plant off from the Ukrainian power grid and keeps increasing psychological pressure on ZNPP employees and their relatives (they regularly receive phone calls threatening them with criminal prosecutions and physical reprisals)

üîµ Attacks of the Kiev regime on ZNPP endanger the safety and security of Europe and the whole world. In case of an accident at this station the radiation contamination zone (more than 5300 square kilometers, length around 420 km) would cover the population of Kievskaya, Zaporozhskaya, Kharkovskaya, Poltavskaya, Khersonskaya, Odesskaya, Nikolaevskaya, Kirovogradskaya, Vinnitskaya oblasts, Donetsk and Lugansk People‚Äôs Republics, border areas of Russia and Belarus, as well as Moldova, Bulgaria and Romania. The situation could get worse because of adverse weather conditions and spread of possible contamination zone to South-Ukrainian NPP and the nuclear fuel storage at Chernobyl NPP, as well as water arteries. The Black Sea and the Bosphorus Strait would become unsuitable for navigation for a long time. The shores of Abkhazia, Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania and T√ºrkiye would be contaminated with high levels of radiation

‚ùóÔ∏èThe UN, the IAEA, as well as all countries that have influence on the Kiev regime should do everything possible to ensure immediate cessation of Ukrainian attacks on ZNPP before they resulted in devastating consequences for the whole mankind",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,39916.0,260.0,,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,3.0,91.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,1308.0,,,,,,,,MessageReplies,0.0,25478.0,False,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1592391298.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Der Europaabgeordnete der Gr√ºnen Lagodinsky nannte Russl√§nder Drittweltb√ºrger und begr√ºndete die Verweigerung von Visa mit ‚ÄûMisshandlung und Mord in Butscha‚Äú: 

""Es geht um die Einreise in andere L√§nder. Ich sehe nicht, dass Vertreter von L√§ndern der Dritten Welt, der arabischen Welt oder des Iran frei in unsere L√§nder einreisen k√∂nnten. 

Wir m√ºssen uns jetzt entscheiden, was uns strategisch wichtiger ist. Um den russischen B√ºrgern, die diese Aggression unterst√ºtzen, zu zeigen, dass dies seine Konsequenzen hat, und dass es auch Konsequenzen f√ºr sie gibt. Oder um ihnen eine Alternative aufzuzeigen ‚Äì dass wir nicht irgendein zusammenbrechendes Europa sind, sondern um zu zeigen, wie gut Europa lebt. 

Aber das ist naiv, und wir m√ºssen √ºber die Einschr√§nkung nachdenken. Keine Touren zu den wundersch√∂nen Schl√∂ssern von Dresden, in einer Situation, in der Mariupol bombardiert wurde, wenn Menschen in Butscha misshandelt und ermordet werden. Es ist unzeitgem√§√ü, Touristenvisa auszustellen, um die Architektur Dresdens ansehen zu lassen.""

üí¨ Verschweigen ukrainischer Kriegsverbrechen, Stillschweigen zu den Rechtsradikalen von Asow und deren Misshandlungen und Beschuss von Mariopolern B√ºrger, Beschuldigungen ohne internationale Untersuchungen mit abschlie√üendem Urteil = Vorverurteilungen, Neokoloniales Gebaren vom hohen Ross (Drittweltb√ºrger, schaut wie gut wir es hier in Europa haben), Diskriminierung von B√ºrgern aus echten Entwicklungsl√§ndern mit diesem Ausspruch sowieso, Faschistoide Kollektivschuld-Bestrafung von Russl√§ndern - das ist das, was wir in diesem Interview sehen.

""Alles gut, das wird heilen.""

Insgesamt verbrachte Yuri mehr als einen Monat in Gefangenschaft und wurde dann gegen einen ukrainischen Soldaten ausgetauscht:

Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said. 

She has already been supported by Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin on the issue of abolishing tourist visas to Europe for Russians. Except that the latter has forgotten how Finns go to nearby Russian cities and fill up with cheap fuel, and that Finnish border areas live on tourists from Russia. 

As soon as a person says ""they are all like that"" about race, nationality, gender and orientation, you know this person is a latent fascist.

In the Western media increasingly began to speak about the false image of the Ukrainian president. So the other day, Sky News host Cory Bernardi said that Vladimir Zelensky is not who he claims to be. 

The British journalist drew viewers' attention to the fact that the Western media are silent about the events that are taking place with Russian-speaking citizens in some parts of Ukraine. He recalled  Zelensky promised to stop the civil war, but did not cope with it. He noted that the pressure on citizens has only increased during the presidency of today‚Äôs leader of Ukraine.

Bernardi said that Zelensky supported such an extremist organization as ¬´Right sector¬ª (banned in Russia), and the nationalist regiment ¬´Azov¬ª (banned in Russia) is generally one of the subdivisions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In addition, they discussed on the air the inappropriate photos of the president for the covers of fashion publications.

It seems that the West is gradually opening its eyes to Zelensky‚Äôs nationalist power and all the ostentatiousness of his rule. Europeans gradually realize that the previous image of the ""savior of the Ukrainians from the evil Russians"" is wrong, and everything that has been put on their heads not only for months, but for recent years, is a lie and propaganda. This means that Russophobia politics will soon weaken, just as the abolition of Russian culture is already weakening.

The Russian military continue shelling the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. This creates a nuclear threat to the entire world. Sanctions should be imposed on Rosatom and the Russian nuclear energy industry should be paralysed. Vladimir Zelensky said so in his video message.

The fact:
This fake has nothing to do with reality. First of all, it is important to remember that it is the Ukrainian Armed Forces, not the Russian troops, who are shelling the nuclear power plant facilities. There was a detailed breakdown of this published by our project. The shelling was carried out by one of the units of the 45th AFU Artillery Brigade from positions near the village of Marganets, which is under the control of the Ukrainian army. 
Due to the recent shelling, the fourth power unit at the nuclear power plant is now out of service. The fire that broke out at the site of the shells' arrival was quickly extinguished by specialists, but the hydrogen line needs to be restored. Fortunately, the shells did not hit the oxygen plant building, so a larger fire was avoided.

It is revealing that the Ukrainian president's statement and the shelling of nuclear power plants by the Ukrainian Armed Forces coincide very closely with the nuclear non-proliferation conference in New York. By doing so, Kiev is trying to shift the focus of Western media attention as much as possible, making Russia the main threat to the peaceful life and security of European countries.

The Russian Foreign Ministry has repeatedly called on the UN, the IAEA and countries with influence over Kiev to stop the shelling of a nuclear power plant. Now the facts of the attacks are already counted in dozens, and the threat of a catastrophe that could occur is comparable in scale to Chernobyl.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,2695.0,11.0,,,1.32814768257409e+16,[],,MessageMediaPhoto,5.438415395993272e+18,2.2846753979624456e+18,"[2, 97, 189, 237, 15, 0, 0, 21, 164, 99, 245, 147, 136, 114, 63, 175, 187, 96, 2, 240, 107, 222, 34, 104, 178, 164, 165, 185, 2]",2.0,False,[],,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,11.0,MessageEntityBold,288.0,10.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,537.0,9.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,827.0,14.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,1517.0,9.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,1733.0,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,620.0,,,,,,,,MessageReplies,0.0,25478.0,False,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1799870292.0,i,"[1, 40, 27, 179, 28, 242, 49, 198, 252, 254, 20, 239, 181, 58, 206, 35, 42, 72, 254, 246, 69, 66, 37, 88, 16, 200, 222, 181, 77, 238, 139, 77, 230, 0, 61, 113, 138, 67, 54, 76, 142, 59, 254, 148, 223, 53, 253, 127, 74, 130, 59, 128, 232, 25, 198, 220, 211, 188, 196, 254, 245, 0, 78, 201, 17, 27, 89, 1, 30, 152, 20, 209, 5, 183, 252, 241, 67, 255, 0, 1, 21, 41, 94, 122, 26, 77, 158, 198, 152, 134, 133, 128, 0, 4, 75, 143, 247, 69, 72, 34, 143, 251, 139, 249, 82, 108, 62, 149, 32, 24, 24, 160, 6, 3, 207, 67, 249, 82, 228, 251, 254, 148, 81, 64, 6, 126, 191, 165, 46, 71, 173, 20, 80, 7]",m,215.0,320.0,20696.0,x,433.0,643.0,"[3761, 9806, 21307, 32002, 49114]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Message,5539,1639836943,2022-08-10T10:56:01+00:00,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"Fake news:
Ukraine will conduct a successful counterattack and recapture Kherson. Ukrainian officials, from President Volodymyr Zelensky to Ukrainian military experts, have repeatedly stated this. Foreign media also wrote about the coming offensive.

The fact:
Such statements have been made since early July, but there are still no signs of a counteroffensive. At the beginning of August, Ukraine announced that there would not be one this year. And as for today, Mykhailo Podolyak, advisor to the head of Zelensky's office, called reports of an imminent attack by the Ukrainian Armed Forces on Kherson ""part of an information and psychological operation"". 

""Certainly, all public comments today are part of the information and psychological operations We need to demoralize the Russian army <...> we have a completely different war, a 'creative war', and our partners can see that,"" Podolyak said in an interview with the BBC.

We wrote back in mid-July that Kiev would not be able to organize an effective counteroffensive. Ukraine does not have the people, equipment, or other resources to do this. Ukrainian and foreign sources, among others, have drawn attention to this fact. 

In fact, most of Ukraine's virtual victories are a psychological operation, which was covered as much as possible in the media. The Ukrainian Armed Forces shelled the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, blaming the Russian military with absolutely no evidence, showered Donetsk with anti-personnel mines, hit the Antonov bridge over the Dnieper, trying unsuccessfully to prove that this would create serious difficulties for the Russian Armed Forces. The main purpose of these attacks is to manipulate the consciousness of TV viewers and readers of the Ukrainian and Western press into believing that the AFU is ""indomitable power,"" which in fact it is not.

Since the end of July, the Telegram channels reported, citing a source in the office of the president of Ukraine, that the virtual battle for Kherson was being used to ""change public opinion in the West and create new momentum for international support for Ukraine,"" that is, to get another sum for ""rebuilding the country"" and another batch of Western weapons, which are actively flowing into the ""black market.""",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,6952.0,14.0,,,,[],,MessageMediaWebPage,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,11.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,195.0,1.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,216.0,5.0,MessageEntityBold,251.0,10.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,292.0,16.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,398.0,9.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,526.0,6.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,934.0,5.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,1104.0,9.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,1118.0,7.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,1341.0,7.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,1445.0,8.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,1489.0,3.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,1888.0,8.0,MessageEntityTextUrl,2224.0,7.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,646.0,,,,,,,,MessageReplies,0.0,25478.0,False,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WebPage,5.081221150910058e+18,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1799870292.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Then, since May 18, the AFU has been firing these mines into settlements not only of the DPR, but also into the liberated territory of the Kharkov region.

Since July 27, Ukrainian war criminals have been launching similar missiles equipped with prohibited ‚ÄúLepestok‚Äù mines on the most densely populated neighborhoods of Donetsk.

As of August 2, locations in Voroshilovsky, Kievsky, Kuibyshevsky, Kirovsky, Petrovsky, Kalininsky districts of Donetsk are mined. On July 29, prohibited ‚ÄúLepestok‚Äù mines were found in the village of Panteleimonovka, as well as in Makeevka.

According to the expert assessment of the DPR Ministry of Emergency Situations, Ukrainian criminals scattered several thousand prohibited mines in Donetsk alone. This assessment is based on the main method of mining with the help of the MLRS ‚ÄúUragan‚Äù, the rocket of which contains 12 mine distribution canisters with 320 anti-personnel mines of the ‚ÄúLepestok‚Äù  PFM, the use of which has been repeatedly recorded by the DPR Representative Office in the JCCC.

In total.

An interesting investigation here by RT

The Ukrainian operation to steal a Russian military aircraft, thwarted by the FSB, was supervised, among other things, by British intelligence. This was told by the pilots who were trying to recruit.

Representatives of the Ukrainian special services offered them $2 million for the hijacking, as well as European passports for them and their families.

In order to gain the trust of Russians, Ukrainians shared information that they were not allowed to disclose. They asked the pilots to shoot a video next to specific aircraft (they wanted to make sure that those really have access to equipment).

For these shots, they also promised a reward, which was handed over by couriers ‚Äî recruited girls. Later it turned out that Christo Grozev, the Bellingcat employee, was also connected with the Ukrainian special services.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,54181.0,317.0,,,,[],,MessageMediaDocument,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,MessageEntityTextUrl,190.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,517.0,,,,,,,,MessageReplies,0.0,25478.0,False,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Document,5.399913341600668e+18,2.951989891142725e+18,"[2, 97, 189, 237, 15, 0, 0, 18, 165, 99, 245, 147, 139, 216, 246, 214, 42, 178, 119, 105, 91, 106, 220, 159, 115, 203, 166, 108, 187]",2022-07-25T07:51:04+00:00,video/mp4,99550170.0,2.0,,,,,PeerChannel,1419769554.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PhotoStrippedSize,i,"[1, 22, 40, 132, 62, 20, 212, 145, 75, 207, 90, 168, 28, 114, 13, 62, 50, 185, 192, 207, 52, 132, 79, 230, 225, 152, 231, 145, 218, 144, 73, 147, 86, 35, 17, 152, 247, 28, 99, 169, 170, 76, 248, 115, 128, 125, 120, 161, 171, 21, 185, 56, 152, 115, 142, 212, 85, 108, 238, 36, 246, 162, 149, 196, 209, 6, 224, 58, 174, 127, 26, 151, 116, 96, 3, 131, 159, 243, 239, 69, 20, 192, 112, 187, 80, 49, 131, 249, 127, 245, 233, 190, 98, 28, 147, 187, 39, 175, 249, 205, 20, 80, 52, 49, 159, 0, 237, 24, 252, 104, 162, 138, 0]",,,,DocumentAttributeVideo,612.0,1920.0,1080.0,,True,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The maximum age of those who can be recruited during the mobilization campaign in Ukraine is now 70 years. Some time ago it was 55, then it was 60 and now 70. That is a pity, of course, but I can explain why. When almost all young and adult men up to 50 years old have already fled the country, there are only senior citizens left. Moreover, when your army suffers unacceptable losses, making old and mostly weak due to bad health people die for nothing. That is basically why Mr. Zelensky does what he does.

Depuis des ann√©es certains agents publics pervers narcissiques, sadiques et criminels, utilisent un programme ill√©gal et frauduleux tenu ""secret"", mais defini d√©fini officiellement sous le nom de ""Cybertorture"".

C'est une large gamme de technologies dissimul√©es au grand public et d√©crites dans l'article.

La surveillance accrue, l‚Äôutilisation d‚Äôimplants, de nanotechnologie et les armes √©lectroniques sont parmi des moyens d‚Äôy parvenir. Parmi ses techniques, nous pouvons citer l‚Äôintimidation, le harc√®lement, la torture, la discrimination, la diffamation, les arrestations ill√©gales et les internements abusives, ainsi que d'autres tactiques qui d√©passent l'imagination...

Il a √©t√© rapport√© que certains criminels, agissant sous le nom des services de renseignement, ont recours √† des moyens d'√âtat comme la¬†robotique, l‚Äôintelligence artificielle, la nanotechnologie, la neurotechnologie, la pharmaceutique et les sciences biom√©dicales"".

MK / Cybertorture / Gang Stalking 
Par France Quenneville

Des cr√©puscules de terroristes et/ou n√©o-nazis, infiltr√©s dans les gangs criminalis√©s et les groupes terroristes, r√©alisent des contrats de torture sur des personnes qui sont cibl√©es par le Gang Stalking.
i.e. Ceux qui n'aiment pas les femmes en profitent pour les torturer et les d√©truire d‚Äôune fa√ßon perverse et sadique ; tout ce qui symbolise la femme (seins, vulve, vagin, ovaires...), sont identifi√©s chez elles et tout ce qu‚Äôils ne supportent pas de voir chez elles, un cerveau intelligent par exemple. 

C‚Äôest un crime haineux contre des victimes √† l'int√©rieur du crime du Gang Stalking - qui se d√©veloppe rapidement, et qui s'en prend surtout aux femmes seules ou aux personnes vuln√©rables (ou rendues vuln√©rables par ces pratiques).",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityUrl,530.0,33.0,MessageEntityUrl,2320.0,89.0,MessageEntityUrl,2445.0,223.0,MessageEntityUrl,2704.0,32.0,MessageEntityUrl,3167.0,30.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReplyHeader,4623.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are Western Ukrainians who have come to Russia and behave terribly and aggressively.But the police explain to them that they must behave respectfully.

Many people in Russia have relatives, they go to them. There were popular people in Kiev who started telling the truth. But they were hunted, hundreds of people were imprisoned and killed. Those who miraculously managed to escape are also now in Russia or hiding in Europe. But in Europe they are transferred to Ukraine. Therefore, it is more or less safe in Russia. Now a very famous musician and producer Yuri Bardash is hiding from Ukraine. He is from Kiev, but originally from Lugansk. He created a clip where the whole truth about Ukraine and Zelensky. Zelensky didn't like it and was ordered to kill him. Ordinary people are afraid to tell the truth, because inadequate Ukrainians immediately hand them over to the SBU. People are tortured or killed there, many disappear without a trace. And there are Ukrainians who know the truth, but purposefully lie.. no Russian can understand them. My relatives in Ukraine taught their children from two textbooks, one Ukrainian.. where is the hatred of Russians, where Ukraine has equipped all of Europe and everything came from Ukrainians (all of Europe). And the second textbook is Russian, where the whole story is written as it was. If the neighbors find out about this, they will give up my relatives and kill them.

‚ÄòDark, barbaric and savage‚Äô is how rulers and philosophers in the West have portrayed Russia throughout history. The image lives on and flourishes in the media and popular culture. 

The documentary traces the origins of the anti-Russian narrative and explores who benefits from the idea of an ‚Äòirrational and dangerous nation‚Äô. It also takes a look at how the anti-Russian sentiment spread across Europe. 

Researchers, historians and writers talk about the shaping of Western disdain for Russia from the Great Schism to contemporary anti-Russia hysteria.

A doctor from the 4th hospital of Mariupol, Svetlana Slapinova, tells the Ukrainian troops were hiding behind women and children.

‚Äî The scariest thing, probably, was when we went upstairs from the basement... and saw a Ukrainian tank drive up, shoot and drive back.

When our girls came up and said ‚Äì What are you doing? You shot back and left, there are women, old people, children here, then the answer was shocking ‚Äì Who should we hide behind?

(I) went out to a quiet place... and at that time there was a shot from the right, five seconds later a shot from the left. I realized that now (there would be a shot) in the head, I squat quickly.

Anatoly Borisovich, a citizen of the Cheryomushki district of Mariupol, says:

‚Äî They were divided as: the Ukranian military and the Nazis, or ""Azov"". The Ukranian military guys are normal. They were hiding in the basement where I was sitting. 

The ""Azovites"", those guys were arrogant. If they needed something ‚Äì a building, or a house ‚Äì they drove all people out‚Ä¶

They fired at (our) houses, those Nazis. There were no DPR troops anywhere near. They say that it was the ""Azovites"" who forced the residents out of their homes.

From The Independent:

European companies have almost doubled their shipments of Russian oil since February, despite desperate efforts by EU leaders to squeeze the Kremlin by blocking Russia‚Äôs exports from global markets.

Europe‚Äôs three major shipping countries ‚Äì Greece, Cyprus and Malta ‚Äì have rapidly increased the amount of Russian oil they were transporting each month since the start of the war in Ukraine.

Despite the European Commission announcing plans to ban seaborne imports of Russian crude into the trading bloc, Russian oil will continue to flow into Europe via a pipeline through Hungary, and after lobbying from shipping interests in Greece, Malta and Cyprus, EU-registered boats and companies will be allowed to continue moving oil from Russian ports to non-EU countries.

That means EU companies can continue to profit from facilitating transfers of Russian oil to countries such as India and China, which have proved to be willing buyers for the crude oil that Europe no longer wants.

As oil prices have risen sharply, the Russian government has seen a huge boost to its finances and is on track to receive an unprecedented $250bn inflow of cash this year.

A quick reminder, one of the pillars of the Ukrainain propaganda was an ""Russian air strike"" on a maternity hospital in Mariupol. However, the women in labor themselves denied this. They said that the explosion was carried out by Ukrainian soldiers near the hospital, there were also professional photographers for the Western media there, just by coincidence.

Furthermore, these lies was spread around the world to justify sanctions and threats against Russia, as well as incite hatred against Russia.

What will happen to NATO's Turkey now? Will Syrian flags fly all around the globe? Will there be breaking news and damnatory news headings? Will there be ""sanctions from hell""?

Vladislav Pankeev and Polina Lutsyuk from Mariupol tell about the lack of assistance from the Ukrainian military and the city authorities:

‚Äî Did the Ukrainian authorities or the military provide any assistance to citizens?

‚Äî No. None at all. We were simply thrown to the mercy of fate, and we lived from the fact that people had broken into a store and three houses lived on it. But for it, everything would be bad.

‚Äî Was there any information about humanitarian corridors from the Ukrainian authorities?

‚Äî The only thing on the radio was that the DPR troops were not allowed in. I think it's nonsense.

‚Äî What do you think about Zelensky as the president of Ukraine?

‚Äî I didn't vote for him. ¬†He is a comedian. It's a kind of jokes for him. And even now he's probably on drugs too.

‚Äî There is a column of people and they follow them, because they understand that they would not shoot at people.

‚Äî The ""Azovites"" drove people into the basement and simply locked people and left. And only when the military (Russians) came... they were opened. For 11 days people were sitting in the basement without anything ‚Äì without food, without water. That guy told me ‚Äì We opened a jar of peas and divided for a pea among people...

They ran into the apartment, they said ‚Äì put on white armbands, you will go ahead as a human shield. They started lying that they were not locals, that they did not know the way... Mother said ‚Äì these are my sons, I will cover them with my chest... mother was still able to defend them.

In this part, the refugees from Mariupol, Vladislav Pankeev and Polina Lutsyuk, tell the militants of ""Azov"" and the Ukranian military fought among themselves, how they threatened Vladislav when they wanted to take away his car and how they behaved before the start of the special operation:

‚Äî After they left your car, did they say something?

‚Äî They began to threaten me, literally ‚Äì started reloading the machine gun. They couldn't start the car. I said - the keys are hidden, even if you kill me, you won't find them anyway.

‚Äî In 2016-2017 they said that Mariupol citizens were all separatists and they would not spare us. ¬†People said that a boy had his ears just cut off. A 16-year-old boy was taken out of the house, men and women were lined up in a column and they began to torture them.

Most people just hate. And there is a reason. They know that Ukraine did not even try to provide them with any humanitarian assistance, it was only from Russia. Not only Ukraine failed to carry out a full-fledged evacuation, but they blocked it, they did not let out convoys with women and children, civilians were killed by the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the ‚ÄúAzov‚Äù, they robbed, civilian houses were shot.

In this video, a citizen of Mariupol, Natalia Saenko, shares her opinion about the Kiev regime.

‚Äî I don't consider him to be the president.

Lyudmila Sysoeva from Mariupol tells about the shooting of civilians who went for water by Ukrainian militants:

‚Äî Where there is a mosque, there is a spring. We went there to get water. Military Ukrainians went there too for water. My husband and I went for water. Two men overtook us, and I stopped. What a blessing that I stopped. Ten more steps and that's it‚Ä¶ 

They, for sure, Ukrainians, began to shell the road where people were coming with water. They began to shoot‚Ä¶ I looked at that man - his stomach was completely slashed...

Nadezhda Kozub from Mariupol tells about the crimes of the ¬´Azov¬ª militants during the special military operation:

‚Äî How did the ‚ÄúAzov‚Äù militants behave after the start of the military operation?

‚Äî I saw with my own eyes that when there was a shootout between the Ukranian military and the DPR in the Vinogradny area, shells flew from here in a circle at residential buildings. They just shot at civilians‚Ä¶ They were just shooting up the city.

...A guy came running in only flip-flops and a light T-shirt. Everyone started asking ‚Äì What happened? He said that ""Azov people"" came in, kicked everyone out into the street, took what they liked, and what they didn't like, they just poured fuel and burned it down.

‚Äî Brazenly. You know, no way. They condemned ‚Äì here is Russia, hiding behind people, settling in schools, in houses‚Ä¶ ¬†I heard it on the radio when the electricity was on.

And what did they do? They drove people out of houses into the basement and occupied apartments themselves. Here on Krasnoflotskaya st they stood between the houses and fired guns‚Ä¶ They kicked them out of schools.

‚Äî And they said that the Russians did it?

Refugees from Mariupol, Vladislav Pankeev and Polina Lutsyuk, tell the Ukranian militants shot civilians who went to get water:

‚Äî There wasn‚Äôt much good. They didn't help in anything. No water to get, nothing. Our people went (for water), neighbors from the entrance, and did not arrive. They were simply shot dead from an armored personnel carrier. It was a Ukrainian armored personnel carrier. 

And this is not an isolated case‚Ä¶ Therefore, we went to the sauna next to us, drew water with bleach from the pool.

In this video, a citizen of Mariupol, Nadezhda Kozub, continues to tell about the excesses of the ‚ÄúAzov‚Äù militants before the start of the special military operation:

‚Äî ...a man near the gates of the 61st school was having an argument with them, with the ""Azov"". He was pretty drunk, that man. I asked what the problem was, why he was swearing like that. 

He said that someone from his close relatives had been dragged to this school and tortured with a red-hot pipe, they burned that guy just to death.

A citizen of Mariupol, Nadezhda Kozub, tells how the ‚ÄúAzov‚Äù militants behaved before the start of the special military operation:

‚Äî How did the representatives of the ‚ÄúAzov‚Äù battalion behave all these years?

‚Äî To put it mildly, they treated the locals very unkindly. They behaved rudely, impudently. A lot of men went missing, and before that they had had conflicts with the ""Azov"".

About 2020, some guys went to play billiards. The ""Azovites"" came in drunk. They were going to start a conflict. Our guys just came out. They caught up with them, one had his throat cut from ear to ear, the second died from stab wounds, the third was hit on the head with a rifle and he survived.

A citizen of Mariupol, Lyudmila Sysoeva, tells she and her husband were fired at by a Ukrainian sniper:

‚Äî There was no one, no military‚Ä¶ And a Ukrainian sniper went to shoot at us. As soon as he fired, I was immediately burned, and my arm went numb...

I said to my husband ‚Äì Edik, I must have been shot. He bent down... if he hadn't bent down, he would have been killed. He bent down to me, and his back was slashed.

We ran to the houses, and there people were cooking. We came running, and they looked at us and said ‚Äì God, you are safe. We thought you wouldn't survive.

And a man was running after us, he didn't get up...

West Ukraine and the government who came from the revolution supported by Usa and bilions invested in that revolution wanted to go in Nato and Ukraine. And all diffrent opinion was silenced. Ukraine had in its constitution from 1991 that it will be a neutral country. Considering the location you are in, it is same as Mexico building chinese and russian military bases. Ukraine was fooled by the west, and then thorn apart by Russia and the West. It should have kept its neutral status. But we must not forget ukrainian troops joined the invasions of Afghan and Iraq. So they are not neutral from 2001. Legally a new president came in 2010 who said we are not going to join nato, and shit started. Main reasons is Nato expansion to the east and destroying russia army so it cant block their future plans like in Syria or Lybia. And if you really think Nato cares about independence or about Ukraine, respecting borders this is really funny. People of Ukraine are not to be blamed, they were fooled by having to pick side Russia or Nato, and they should have not picked anybody. So this is not Ukraine- Russia war, it is Nato- Russia war.

In this video, a resident of Mariupol, Vladimir Ivanovich Marushin, talks about how the ‚ÄúAzov‚Äù militants have been robbing civilians since 2014:

‚Äî 30 people entered the house of relatives on the side of my wife in Novoselovka. They were kicked out with their children. The husband was beaten. Two children: one is 12 years old, the other is 14. 10 days later, when they returned, the house was already ruined. Everything was smashed, everything was crumbled, everything was broken. Even in the cellar, everything was destroyed.

The Ukranian military did not commit atrocities like ‚ÄúAzov‚Äù. No one said kind words (about ""Azov""). They're just louts‚Ä¶ We called them ""zarobitchans"".

They call home - here's a refrigerator ... ""Novaya Pochta"" did not have time to work... they really just robbed.

In this video, a resident of Mariupol, Alexander Putilov, 54 years old, tells how the ‚ÄúAzov‚Äù militants fired tanks from the hospital, how they drove people out of their homes and basements:

‚Äî Witnesses told us that the ""Azovites"" occupied the 4th hospital...

‚Äî They did not occupy that. They stayed near the hospital, the tank stayed and started hitting somewhere... they specifically stayed between hospitals, between buildings. Then they would put mines, start shooting, put tanks, start shooting.

‚Äî And where else were they located...?

‚Äî Wherever they went. They drove people out of the houses, out of the basements. They themselves were based in basements‚Ä¶  Go, look for another basement...

A resident of Mariupol, Vladimir Ivanovich Marushin, talks about how he was wounded as a result of the shelling of the ‚ÄúAzov‚Äù national unit from the ‚ÄúAzovstal‚Äù:

‚Äî ...the first victim ‚Äì a mine flew into the house and killed a young guy, my neighbor. The house was blown to shreds. We buried him, removed the drawer in the kitchen, put him in, buried him.

‚Äî And where did the mine come from?

‚Äî ...it flew only from the factory, because all the sounds of these mines started from the side of the ‚ÄúAzovstal‚Äù plant. From time to time, shells flew in. Six houses were smashed around at once‚Ä¶ On April 11, my wife and I went, we wanted to get Phoenix SIM cards. On the way home, they started shooting from the ‚ÄúAzovstal‚Äù‚Ä¶ We lay down just in time, it covered us with earth.

Shockingly, as in every nation - day to day life matters more than philosophical nothingness. 

Before - no one cares - only idiots. So badly people want to be Ukraine and Russia to be like France and Spain. England or Scotland.  No. Just people existing. 

Do you know what the generation born after the collapse is called? Three names but only one real one.

¬´Children of Russia¬ª - born into a new world

You laugh when Ukrainian nationalist commit war crimes, verified by Western Media.

Message,554,1639836943,,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"Arriving from Ukraine to Russia in January 2022 and up to this day, I faced a terrifying wall of misunderstanding by some Russians of the situation in Ukraine. Namely, how deeply Nazism and its Western ‚Äúmasters‚Äù have taken root there, and what a mortal danger they pose to both Russians and Ukrainians themselves.

Ukrainians are peace-loving people! (I used to think so myself). But in Ukraine for 8 years every minute they say that there is a war with the Russian aggressor in the Donbass! For 8 years, a stream of shit and fakes have been pouring from all channels that the war with Russia has ALREADY been going on since 2014! There are no alternative sources of information there!

""We don't have Nazis!"" call Ukrainian relatives. Under Hitler, too, not all Germans were SS. They were only a few percent. But most of society silently supported them. History repeats itself. Those Ukrainians who do not see the Nazis at all should look in the mirror!

It is necessary to reach a peace agreement, Muscovites say. ‚ÄúFuck in your Rashka‚Äù, ‚Äúright now I‚Äôll write to the prosecutor‚Äôs office about you‚Äù, ‚Äúsuch people should be hanged together with Muscovites‚Äù - Ukrainians will respond to those who calls for peace. And those who publicly call for peace and sanity in Ukraine will, at best, be locked up in prison as ‚Äúcollaborators‚Äù, and at worst, their corpse will be used to set up another fake. If those stars, journalists, fugitive politicians who abandoned their homeland were sent to Ukraine now, the Nazis would hang them on the nearest post, because for them ""a good Muscovite is a dead Muscovite.""

Then, until now, some do not understand why they say Russia was the first to attack.
These people ignore all the oral and written evidence that the Russian intelligence came to an unequivocal conclusion: in early March, Ukraine was preparing a large-scale offensive against the Crimea and Donbass. In this case, Mariupol tells about their fate. I did not own intelligence data, but among my personal acquaintances, many were sent in January-February 2022 FOR EXERCISES. That's why I left, I realized what would happen.

Calls to kill all Russians and even Russian children from Ukrainian journalists or politicians are not a reservation, THEY REALLY WANT AND READY to do this. Since 2014, the Nazis and the SBU, supervised by Western intelligence agencies, have killed Buzina, Sheremet, people in the house of trade unions, and many others. And they continue to kill today everyone who is suspected of ""collaborationism."" And now they understand everything that goes against the interests of the bloody regime. Therefore, there will be no mass support for the Russians in Ukraine until the local population is sure that they will not be left behind and then they will not face massacre. And there is already a terrible hunt going on.

And the last. Ukrainians without Russians will not cope with these ghouls. They will be doomed to a quick or slow death, as Zelensky said, to the last Ukrainian. From the war there will be casualties in any case, but someone will survive. If the Nazis remain, only death awaits my people.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,2022-04-29T03:00:03+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,True,,,,,,,,,,MessageReplyHeader,549.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessagePeerReaction,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerUser,5133916468.0,ReactionEmoji,üëç,,,,csv/original/Channel-WARCRIMESINUKRAINEchat_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this video, Anton Baitrakov, a serviceman of the 501st battalion of the Ukrainian military Marines, tells he witnessed the murder of a civilian by a Ukrainian senior sergeant Cherednik Anton only because he decided that the citizen of Mariupol was Russian - he did not say the word ""palyanitsa"" with Ukrainian accent.

‚Äî Two civilians were walking at the intersection. Cherednik, the senior, says - Wait, come here‚Ä¶ He shot at the ground, then they stopped.

He didn't like those people, he asked how ""palyanitsa"" would be... he asked ""palyanitsa"" three times from one‚Ä¶ There was no response, he took him for a Russian and I heard him fire a shot at the guy.

‚Äî initially, cars drove around the village at night. The next morning, as a rule, the shelling began at 7 am.

‚Äî Shelling from Ukraine?

‚Äî From Ukraine. From the positions where we knew Ukrainian military was standing. It came from about there.

In other villages I saw the launcher ""Tochka-U"". I would never believe that I would see it... On the launcher (the rocket) it was written: ""The best is for children"".

The head of the Donetsk public organization ""Fair Protection"" Vitaly Galakhov says that since 2015, he has been submitting petitions from victims of Ukraine (relatives of the killed, wounded, etc.) to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).

Out of the 6000 cases from victims of Ukraine for 7 years, the ECHR has not rendered A SINGLE JUDGMENT.

Western sanctions on Russia over Ukraine have failed to end the conflict, but have wreaked havoc on Europe‚Äôs economy and driven up inflation, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has said.

Posting on his Facebook page on Sunday, Orban offered scathing criticism of EU sanctions, claiming the bloc is struggling to tackle inflation due to the restrictions Brussels has introduced in the energy sector. ‚ÄúThe name of the disease is‚Ä¶ inflation, and the virus is called the Brussels sanctions,‚Äù he said.

Orban branded the sanctions ‚Äúthe weapons of Brussels‚Äô war policy,‚Äù adding that while the EU was using this tool to target Russia, it has harmed itself instead.

It's important to remind viewers that the large majority of mainstream media in France supports President Macron, and that CNews, along with Europe 1 is one of the only mainstream media that supports the opposition.

This is apart of a clear pattern of democratic backsliding that we are seeing in France under President Macron, with heavy crackdown on protesters, severe curtainment of religious freedom and now crackdown on the opposition media.

Political scientist Alexei Zhivov @zhivoff especially for the channel ""Soroka-Beloboka"" @soroka_belaya

After the ""cold shower"" of the start of a special military operation, many key experts reconsidered their attitude towards the Ukrainian army and Western weapons. Previously, there was an opinion that Western weapons do not pose a serious threat, and the Ukrainian army does not exist at all.

The results ""on the ground"" made us take a different look at the issues raised, and many publicists rushed to the other extreme. Each tactical success of the Armed Forces of Ukraine began to be elevated to the level of ""victory on the Kursk Bulge."" Moreover, the Russian society began to react to the numerous stuffings from the Ukranian Center of Information and Psychological Operations, producing unfounded fears.

What about in reality? How many ""overcomes"" did the Armed Forces of Ukraine win, and how many did we made up by ourselves for them?

At the beginning of the special military operation, there were several tangible blows against the advancing Russian troops, which led to significant losses in people and equipment. First of all, Kharkov comes to mind. The liberation of Mariupol ended with very heavy fighting. The Armed Forces of Ukraine were able to organize resistance near Kyiv. And, perhaps, everything.

The withdrawal of Russian troops from Kyiv and from the north of Ukraine is the decision of our authorities. At the time the command arrived, the special forces were already working within the city. The Izyum offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine demoralized both society and the army, but the reasons were, again, domestic. Exactly the same offensives in the Kherson region bogged down, burying thousands of Ukrainian solders in the Kherson black soil. Withdrawal from the right bank of the Dnieper is also a political decision. The army successfully coped with the offensive, although it experienced a shortage of supplies.

Where did the myth about the victorious march of the Armed Forces of Ukraine come from? The Ukrainian army has indeed achieved some success, but certainly not in offensive operations. Their forte is defense, primarily urban. Our army ran into it in the Donbass. Cities in eastern Ukraine were prepared in advance for defense ""to the last whole wall.""

The Reich at one time defeated France with lightning speed, simply bypassing the impregnable Maginot Line from the rear. Unfortunately, the Russian army did not succeed in such a maneuver, largely due to the initial underestimation of the situation and hope for a political resolution of the issue. I think if the military operation was originally planned without regard to political instruments and inappropriate humanism, the Armed Forces of Ukraine would not have had a chance.

Most of the victories of the Ukrainian army are a direct consequence of mistakes in the planning and implementation of the operation to liberate Novorossia and Donbass. Ukraine was able to impose urban battles on the Russian army, for which our army was not ready either morally or technically. All the successes of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are associated exclusively with defensive work: the use of artillery and flexible defense, as well as a viscous fight in concrete fortified areas. We have faced a worthy adversary, but the myth about the strength and invincibility of the Ukrainian army is a delusion.

A delusion that was dispelled with the help of morally unstable Russian media with the active support of Ukrainian channels and speakers. The depression of society after the Izyum-Kherson regrouping at some point reached such intensity that people seriously believed in Ukrainian plans to attack Crimea.

In the bottom line, Ukraine was unable to return any of its regions on its own. And its maximum is to contain the smaller Russian army at the cost of colossal losses in manpower and equipment. Zelensky boasted in 2021 of creating a strong army, but now it is more like a dead army than a strong one.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,7331.0,25.0,,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageEntityBold,0.0,67.0,MessageEntityBold,87.0,13.0,MessageEntityMention,101.0,8.0,MessageEntityBold,125.0,29.0,MessageEntityMention,155.0,14.0,MessageEntityBold,1783.0,38.0,MessageEntityBold,1822.0,26.0,MessageEntityBold,2681.0,175.0,MessageEntityBold,3794.0,59.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,442.0,,,,,,,,MessageReplies,10.0,140611.0,False,[],,70369.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1607412881.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-ukrainewarchatroom_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Russia cannot build its own country. why should it build Ukraine?

History shows that Russia does not do this, otherwise the country would be rich today. the Europeans have no natural resources and still have strong economies. why can't Russia do that despite the gift of many raw materials?

simply. it has no interest in it. just look at Germany. FRG and GDR.

Germany was rich because the allies invested. especially the usa after the war. brd got rich. brd had no debts in 1990.

the 2.5 trillion debts that Germany has are because of the GDR. Although so much has been invested in the former GDR, the standard of living in western Germany is higher.

Russia left the GDR in a catastrophic state.

History shows exactly that Russia does not act that way. moscow, saint petersberg... getting richer. the rest remain poor. here is only exploited not built.

history doesn't lie. that's how it happened.

I say if Ukraine loses the war then it will be a very poor country in 50 years under the control of Russia.

If Ukraine wins the war, it will flourish in the EU and its economy will be stronger than Russia.

i go on holiday to poland with friends once or twice a year. i have seen how poland has changed in the first 10 years after joining the eu. these are 2 worlds.

Russia has absolutely no economic interests here. If Russia had any economic interests at all, it would now have a GDP that would be the largest in Europe. largest population, most resources...

‚ÄºÔ∏è More precisely, the Armed Forces of Ukraine are defending Ukrainian soil. While 20,000 Russian convicts have already gone to ""Putin's paradise,"" and the rest are waiting for the same fate solely because of the billions of dollars that Prigozhin wants to dig out of the Ukrainian soil. The ""Bakhmut case"" is absolutely reminiscent of Wagner's African wanderings, with one difference: in Ukraine, a private terrorist company is directly ""backed"" by the Russian state.

The ""cook"" of the F√ºhrer's supreme commander-in-chief seeks to seize the salt and plaster mines near Bakhmut.

üëâ Prigozhin's ""obsession"" with Bakhmut is driven by monetary motives, claims an unnamed American official quoted by Reuters.

üëâ Near Bakhmut is Europe's largest salt deposit, with an area of 179 square kilometers. It has salt reserves of 15,648 million tons.

üëâ On the territory of Bakhmut there are unique deposits of refractory clays and pure gypsum, which were hunted for by most of the world's famous producers of building mixes.

üëâ The profitability from the development of these deposits amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars per year.¬† 

üëâ Wagner is a kind of modern Company with a bias towards the mining industry. Self-sufficient structure with its own army, which promotes the geopolitical interests of the Kremlin in Africa. PMC Wagner has actually created their own economy, based on the looting of natural resources of the black continent.

üëâ In the Central African Republic, the Wagnerites mines gold and diamonds through the company Lobaye Invest, registered in the country. Prigozhin also monopolized the diamond market, forcing all diggers to sell stones to his own company Diamville.

üëâ Two of Prigozhin's gold mining companies, Meroe Gold and M Invest, operate in Sudan. The Wagners also ""cover"" the activities of Gazprombank's company Alliance for Mining Co. LTD. According to Sudanese and Western sources, 70% of all gold mined by Russians is smuggled out via the United Arab Emirates. The Russians are also looking for uranium in Sudan.

In Madagascar, the Wagner's Ferrum Mining got access to deposits of gold, cobalt and uranium.¬† In Burkina Faso, according to authorities in neighboring Ghana, Prigogine got a gold mine in the south of the country.¬† In Mali, according to Reuters, the Wagnerians get about $11 million in cash a year and own several mines. Obviously, we are talking about gold, which is rich in this country.¬† In Mozambique, the mercenaries are interested in ruby deposits.

""We are in 80 percent of the African countries. We own most of the minerals on the continent. We have a lot of illegal mines. We illegally mine 50% of Africa's gold and diamonds,"" Prigozhin ironically says.

His boast, though exaggerated, generally captures the essence of Wagner's activities in Africa. Under the pretext of helping in civil wars, Prigozhin's mercenaries have settled in about 15 countries on the continent. And they are not the only ones.

‚ÄºÔ∏è For them, the war in Ukraine is analogous to African looting, but under the direct protectorate of the Kremlin. The Russian authorities not only provide political cover for the terrorist unit, but also corral tens of thousands of worthless lives as cannon fodder. At the same time, a commercial interest is sacralized, protecting the interests of the ""empire.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,3347.0,13.0,,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageFwdHeader,False,,7312.0,,,,,,,,MessageReplies,0.0,140611.0,False,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerChannel,1519483747.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-ukrainewarchatroom_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Afghanistan, Czech Republic, Georgia, Hungary,... the russians killed over 2 million civilians under the soviet flag.
the nazis were to blame for around 21 million civilian deaths and a total of 41 million victims in Europe.
Even if today one likes to compare Ukraine with the Second World War, it was a different dimension. back then, an average of 32,000 people died every day. i would say we live in a fairly peaceful world compared to the second world war. Despite all the wars and destruction in the Middle East and now the Ukraine war. Ukraine lost 8 million people during World War II. since the current war would have to last over 100 years to reach such numbers. the crimes of the nazis were worse compared to what is happening today.

but what bothers me is that you don't use the past to prevent wars, you use the past to start wars like putin does now. or as you say, victims of the past are no longer victims but perpetrators. I also don't understand that a people who experienced the holocaust now treat the people in Palestine like this.

But I would never let that get to me too much that I feel hate. Emotions are not a good advisor. Wars are started or waged because of emotions. Someone murders his ex-wife because of emotions...

what helps me not to feel hate and to look at it rationally is that all human beings are equal. we are a product of our environment. as an an example. no one is born in Russia who suddenly shouts: ""usa usa usa"" ü§£ if i was born in russia i would probably be a putin supporter now. Maybe I would be in Ukraine and I would kill Ukrainians.

Sadly, I grew up in one of the largest population of extremist Israelis outside of Israel so I have little sympathy for a group of people who now acts as evil as their oppressors had, both in Israeli occupations and here in America. I grew up with a lot of these type, and I hate, that I hate, as much as I do.

They replaced him with his son, who was not popular like his father. But still, he too did a lot of service and was modernizing the country; however, in his later years of ruling, he sometimes got into issues with Western powers. He didn't want to be a puppet of the West and had some tendencies toward working with China and the USSR. Although Iran was not a democracy under the Shah, the living conditions were good. People had social freedoms, could earn a decent living, could travel to Europe without a visa (strong passport), etc. Because the West was afraid that communism would spread to the Middle East, they saw Mullahs as a viable alternative to Shah because religion is anti-communism. There are even correspondences between Carter and Khomeini. Khomeini promised Carter that he would not rule the country himself and that the new government would be pro-US, but he lied. So the West betrayed the Shah, although he was their ally in the Middle East. When we ask ordinary people the age of our fathers and grandfathers, why the revolution? They all say we don't know.

Message,284,1731758208,,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"There are a lot of people in Germany who think that the¬†‚ÄúNationale Volksarmee- NVA‚Äù¬†(National People‚Äôs Army), the army of communist East Germany, would have been able to wipe the floor with their West German opponent, the¬†‚ÄúBundeswehr‚Äù,¬†but I disagree.
I met a lot of former NVA soldiers and officers after the reunification of Germany, served with a few of them together, and when you talk from professional to professional, the picture is very different.
The East German Army did a lot of things better than most NATO armies did. As their country was a dictatorship, the military didn‚Äôt have to care about public opinion or human rights and could practically do whatever they wanted:
High readiness levels. An NVA armored battalion was able to get ready for combat and move to the front line in a few hours. The Bundeswehr, on the other hand, needed 24 to 48 hours to get combat ready.
Well trained personnel. Soldiers were extremely well trained and prepared. Compulsory military service in the NVA lasted much longer than in the Bundeswehr and this meant more time for training.
Better Special Operations Forces. During the Cold War, the¬†Bundeswehr¬†didn‚Äôt have any Special Forces. The military planners thought that our paratroopers were good enough for all kinds of missions. The NVA, on the other hand, had a lot of Special Ops, not only in the Army and Navy but also within the State Security. A long time after the Cold War had ended, I spoke with a guy who was a member of a State Security paramilitary sabotage unit. These guys regularly went to Western Europe to reconnoiter German and NATO military installations. In the event of armed conflict, they would have caused us a lot of problems.
Discipline. The NVA was highly disciplined. An order wasn‚Äôt supposed to be discussed as it sometimes happened in the Bundeswehr. In combat, this is a big plus.
Perfect maintenance. All their equipment was ready to use all the time.
This might look impressive but like many other Eastern European militaries, the NVA also had a lot of problems:
Obsolete and inferior material. Although perfectly working, most Eastern German weapons were Soviet-made and technologically inferior to NATO systems. The NVA had only limited night fighting capability and their tanks (mostly¬†T-55¬†and¬†T-72) weren‚Äôt a match for the Bundeswehr's¬†Leopards¬†or the American¬†M-1 Abrams.
Dependance on the Soviet Union. The GDR (German Democratic Republic) was a satellite state under the rule of the Soviet Union. This was also true for their military. Therefore, in combat, the NVA could only be as good as their military strategists who weren‚Äôt Germans.
Politicized leadership. What impressed me most when I spoke with former NVA soldiers, was how much they hated and despised their officers. In the Bundeswehr, you usually respect your commander, as long as he isn't a total jerk, but not so in the NVA: to become an officer there, you had to be a good communist first. Military capabilities only came second. Of course, this resulted in a highly indoctrinated and less capable officer corps.
Incompetence. Unlike the Bundeswehr, the NVA wasn't built up with the help of former Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS officers. A former ‚ÄúNazi‚Äù officer becoming an NVA General would have been unthinkable. The few higher ranking Wehrmacht officers in the NVA were mostly people that have been ‚Äúturned around‚Äù during their time as POWs in the Soviet Union. Other high ranking staff had been fighting for the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War. They were good communists, but terrible soldiers. In the Bundeswehr, on the other hand, it wasn‚Äôt unusual to see the bearer of a¬†Knight‚Äôs Cross¬†or a¬†Panzer Ace. The Bundeswehr profited from those experts, while the NVA couldn‚Äôt.
Lack of motivation. To have discipline is good, but it isn‚Äôt enough. Eastern German conscripts weren‚Äôt really willing to fight for their country. In most parts of Eastern Germany, the population was able to receive a Western TV signal and therefore, they knew exactly what was going on.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,2022-11-17T13:11:26+00:00,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReactions,,False,True,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReplies,0.0,140611.0,False,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessagePeerReaction,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PeerUser,5427801189.0,ReactionEmoji,üëç,,,,csv/original/Channel-ukrainewarchatroom_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Europe has to wake up! The biggest nuclear power plant of the Europe is on fire. Right this moment. Russian tanks are firing at nuclear power blocks. They are equipped with thermal imagers. They know what they are firing at. They were getting ready for.

I'm reaching out to all Ukrainians, Europeans, people who knows word ""Chornobyl"". Who knows how much grief and sacrifice that explosion at the nuclear power plant brought in. It was a global catastrophe. 

Russia wants to repeat it and is acting on it now. But 6 times more. Europeans, wake up, please! NPP in Zaporizhya has 6 power blocks, there was one in Chornobyl that exploded.

We have contacted the leaders of other countries and our partners. There's no other country in the world, other than Russia, who fired weapons at nuclear power blocks ever. 

For the first time in mankind history terrorists country has used nuclear power terrorism.

""Cover the world in nuclear dust"" ‚Äî it's not just a threat from Russian Federation, it's a reality now. We have no idea what the fire at the NPP will result in.

Russian army needs to be stopped. Immediately alert your government, Ukraine has 15 nuclear power blocks. If there's an explosion, there will be end to all, end to Europe.

Message,126,1610060648,,False,False,False,False,False,False,,"Pentagon orders deployment of 7,000 US troops to Europe, defense official says

From CNN's Nikki Carvajal and Michael Callahan

The US Secretary of Defense has ordered the deployment of 7,000 US service members to Europe, a senior defense official told reporters shortly after US President Joe Biden‚Äôs announcement.¬†

Biden said he‚Äôd authorized ‚Äúthe deployment of ground and air forces already stationed in Europe,‚Äù to Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania. He also said he‚Äôd authorized ‚Äúadditional US force capabilities‚Äù be sent to Germany as part of NATO‚Äôs response, including some forces that had been placed on standby several weeks ago.

‚ÄúThis would comprise an armored brigade combat team with associated capabilities and enablers. They will deploy to Germany to reassure NATO Allies, deter Russian aggression and be prepared to support a range of requirements in the region. We expect them to depart in the coming days,‚Äù the official said.

In White House remarks, Biden reiterated that US forces ""are not and will not be engaged in a conflict with Russia in Ukraine.""

‚ÄúOur forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our NATO allies and reassure those allies in the East,"" he added. ¬†",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MessageReplies,0.0,5154.0,False,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,csv/original/Channel-ukrainerussieupdates_channel_messages_cleaned.csv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Help üá∫üá¶Ukrainian People & mediaüì¢ keep going! 

¬† 

üá∫üá¶Ukraine is facing an unprecedented, full-scale war‚ò¢‚ö†Ô∏èMedia across the country continue to operate under the most challenging circumstances. 

¬† 

üî•They have shown extraordinary courage, but the reality on the ground is that most operations cannot continue from Ukraine alone. This fundraiser is aimed at helping media relocate, set-up back offices and continue their operations from neighboringü´Ç countries

¬† 

‚è≥‚òéÔ∏èWays to support media activities in Ukraineüá∫üá¶ (e.g., purchases of security equipment, paying drivers, medical care) are outlined below. 

¬† 

üåøThis campaign is run by a consortium of The Aid Initiative, Are We Human & Our Planet Daily Foundation, as well as multiple media partners from across the globeüåê

¬† 

ü§ùWe are working with a growing list of Ukrainian media, including Ukrainska Pravda, Zaborona, Detector Media and others. Support is allocated based on urgency of needs in the first place, then distributed proportionally. 

¬† 

‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏èDifferent support options: ‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è

‚úÖ- If you want to provide support to fund media operations in Ukraine, please reach out to Stichting Are We Europe Foundation. 

‚úÖ- If you want to provide funds to individual media directly, contact us and we will provide a list with their details. 

‚úÖ- We are running a separate fundraiser for the Kyiv Independent - if you can support them, please do so. 

‚úÖ- If you are representing other independent media covering the war, want to be a part of the campaign and receive financial or any other help, please send a short description of your media and the list of urgent needs using the contact button on our fundraiser page¬† (bear in mind immediate support on the ground is extremely difficult to provide). 

‚úÖ- If you want to support local and regional media, which are covering the war in other parts of the country, you can also reach out directly to Media Development Foundation.
